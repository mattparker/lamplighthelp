# 8.1.3    Adding {{Outcome}}s: Adding a New {{Person}} in the {{Outcome}} Record

> If the {{person}} is not already on {{Lamplight}}, you may be able to add them from the {{outcome}} record



In some systems it is possible to add an {{outcome}} for someone who is not already on the database. 

- On the 'Attendance' or 'Respondent' tab, type their name in the search box.
- If they do not show up on the drop - down menu click the 'Add to list' button on the right.

A popup window will appear asking you to confirm their details:

- Click the 'save' button when you have checked the information is how you want it to be.

{{Lamplight}} will double-check whether this {{person}} is already on the system, including a check for spelling differences. If there are any {{people}} already on the system who have similar names, they will be shown in another popup window:

If you want to use one of the {{people}} listed, click their row on the table, and they will be added to the main attendance list. 

If you are certain that they are not already on the system, choose the 'click here' button and they will be added to the main attendance list. A profile will also be created for them. You will need to add information to this after you have finished the {{outcome}} record. For more on adding detail to profiles, see [5.1.0 Profiles](/help/index/p/5.1.0).

**Please note**: any profiles added to the system in this way will be given a role of '{{user}}'. You can change this in the 'Contact Details' tab of their profile once you've finished adding the {{outcome}} record. For more on this see [5.3.0 Contact Details Tab](/help/index/p/5.3.0).
