# 29.2.0 Staff Management Module: Contract Details Tab

> Details in the contract are used in different places for the Staff Management Module: the timesheet system uses it in calculations as does the annual leave summary



You will need to enter details into the 'Contract' tab on a person's profile before you can use the timesheet and annual leave calculations.

To enter information:
- Navigate to the 'Contract details' tab in the profile (you will only see this if it is your own profile or you are in the {{staff}} member's direct line of management). 
- Click on the 'Add' button.

A form will open up for you to enter the required details.

- When you have finished click 'Save'.

{{Staff}} may only have one contract open at any time, so if you add a new contract record an existing one that's still open will automatically be marked as 'closed' - the 'date to' will be set automatically.  It is only possible to have one contract open at a time because other calculations depend on pay rates on a particular date.
