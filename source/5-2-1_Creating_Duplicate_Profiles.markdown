# 5.2.1 Creating Duplicate Profiles

> When you add a new profile to {{Lamplight}}, the system will check to see if it is a duplicate. If there is already a {{person}} or {{org}} with the same or similar name, it will be flagged up

If you add a {{person}} or {{org}} to the system with a similar name to one that is already on there, when you click to save the new profile a pop-up box will appear.

- If the {{person}} or {{org}} you are trying to add is shown in the table, click on that table row. This will open up their profile where you can edit their information and add new {{activity}} records.
- If you still want to add the new profile, either because they have a common name which is shared by someone in the table, or because none of the suggested names actually match the one that you are adding, then go to the bottom of the pop-up box and 'click here'.
