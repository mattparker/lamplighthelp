# 23.0.0    {{Eval}}s Module 

> The {{Eval}}s Module gives you the ability to create bespoke surveys, feedback forms and questionnaires, and to report back on your findings 

Evaluation forms are a common way of finding out how things are going with your service users and with your services. Lamplight can help you record and analyse that information in an intutitive and flexible way. You can set up as many surveys as you need with questions of many different types in them. You can then analyse the results in various ways - for more on reporting see section XXXXXXXXX.
