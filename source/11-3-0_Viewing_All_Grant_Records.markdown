# 11.3.0 Viewing All {{Grant}} Records

> You can open a table from the main menu which will show you all the {{grant}} records recorded in {{Lamplight}}. You can also use filters to search for the ones you need

### Viewing the Table

- Click on '{{Activity}}' on the main menu.
- Hover over 'view' on the sub-menu.
- Choose '{{grant}}' from the drop-down list. 
- If you see a final sub-menu choose 'standard {{grant}} listing' to start a fresh view. There may be other options which are saved {{activity}} view templates. For more on this, see [7.3.1 Viewing All {{Activity}} Records Using an {{Activity}} View Template](/help/index/p/7.3.1).

You will see the following screen:

![{{Grant}} records list](60.3.0a.png)

The table shows all {{grant}} records occurring within a set date range ordered by most recent date to oldest (that is the date saved in the record, not the date that they were entered onto the system). The default range of dates shown (for example, all records from two months in the past to two months in the future) can be set in your 'Personal Settings'. These can be different for each individual. For more on this see [16.4.3 Personal Settings: Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3). 

### Choose and Save which Table Columns You See

You can choose which columns you see in the table by right clicking in the coloured header row.  This will bring up a list of all the available columns. If there is a tick next to a column then it will be visible in the table. Unticked items are hidden.

- You can change this by clicking to tick or untick the column you wish to show or hide. 
- If you want to make that change the default view, right click again on the header row, and choose 'Save table columns layout' from the bottom of the list. You will now see your chosen columns when you run this type of table. (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, see below, these will also be saved.) This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  
- Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the standard system view.

### The Table Search Bar

Above the table is a bar marked 'Search'. If you click on this then you will find additional options you can use to filter your records, and some extra columns to add. 

#### Filters

The top section gives you filters that you can use to narrow down the selection of {{grant}} records you see. 

![Searching for particular {{grant}} records](60.3.0d.png)

- Date and time. You can choose the date range that you want the records to cover.
- {{Workarea}}. You can restrict the records to specific {{workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s. 
- {{Staff}} member adding record. This drop-down box lists all {{staff}} on the system. If you only want to see records added by a specific person, choose their name from the list. 
- Location. Use this to restrict your search to {{grant}}s that are linked to a particular place. 
- Show deleted records. If you want to see deleted records in your search, tick this box. No current records will be included in the results. 
- {{Grant}} type. You can restrict your results to a certain type of {{grant}}. 
- If you do not want to filter by a category (for example {{Grant}} type) then you do not need to choose anything from the list. 

#### Additional Data Columns to Display

The second section of the search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Clicking here will give you options to display names of different {{people}} or {{org}}s who are listed in the records' attendance tables, as well as other items from the custom fields in your {{grant}} records.

#### Custom Field Filters

The final section is called 'Custom field filters'. Click on the bar to open it.  This lets you select additional filtering options to narrow down your selection, using details of who attended the {{grant}} record and custom fields unique to your organisation.  

**After applying additional filters, click the 'Fetch data' button to show the matching records.**


### Downloading and Printing the Table

#### Downloading to a Spreadsheet

Just above the results table, make sure that the 'Show' drop-down is set to 'all'. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the table and click the 'Download' button.  
- Depending on your browser, your table may immediately open in a spreadsheet, or you may need to click on a 'Download' box at the bottom of the screen to open it.

#### Opening Print View

- Clicking the 'Print' button at the bottom of the table will open it in a new tab in a print-friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print-friendly tables split by whatever item you choose, for example {{workarea}}. Each one will open in a separate tab.

See [3.5 Tables](/help/index/p/3.5.0) for more help on using tables.
