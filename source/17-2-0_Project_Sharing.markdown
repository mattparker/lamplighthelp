# 17.2.0    {{Project}} Sharing

> By default no information is shared between different {{project}}s. {{Project}} sharing allows you to do so. You must contact Lamplight to enable {{project}} sharing.  

{{Project}} sharing lets you control in fine detail what information is shared between different {{project}}s. You can share profile information as well as {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{eval}} and {{comm}} records. 

This sharing is controlled by policies that determine which {{project}}s the information should be shared with, what information to share, and whether information can be editted. 

These policies specify:

  1. Which {{project}}s to share with
  2. The access level needed for other database operators to be able to view the shared record
  3. How much of the record to share (for example, just name but not contact details
  4. Whether operators in other {{project}}s may add to or edit the record, or just view it
Your system administrator will need to set up policies for profile sharing and {{work}} etc. record sharing. 

- For more information on setting up policies see [24.6.1  {{Project}} sharing - setting up policies](/help/index/p/24.6.1). 

Once these policies are in place, you need to apply the policy to particular records. **No information is shared until you explicitly choose to do so.**

- For more information on sharing profiles, see section [24.6.2  {{Project}} sharing - sharing profiles](/help/index/p/24.6.2). 
- For more on sharing {{work}} etc. records see section [24.6.3  {{Project}} sharing - sharing {{work}} etc. records](/help/index/p/24.6.3).
