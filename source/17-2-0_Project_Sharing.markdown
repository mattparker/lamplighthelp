# 17.2.0 <i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> {{Project}} Sharing

> By default, no information is shared between different {{project}}s. {{Project}} sharing allows you to do so. You will need to ask us to enable {{project}} sharing for you



{{Project}} sharing lets you control what information is shared between different {{project}}s. You can share profile information as well as {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{eval}} and {{comm}} records. 

This sharing is controlled by policies which specify:

- Which {{project}}s to share with.
- The access level needed for database operators in other {{project}}s to be able to view the shared record.
- How much of the record to share (for example, just name but not contact details).
- Whether operators in other {{project}}s may add to or edit the record, or just view it.

These policies will need to be set up by your System Administrator. 

For more information on setting up policies see:
- [17.2.1 {{Project}} Sharing: Setting Up {{Activity}} Sharing Policies](/help/index/p/17.2.1). 
- [17.2.3 {{Project}} Sharing: Setting Up Profile Sharing Policies](/help/index/p/17.2.3).

Once these policies are in place, you need to apply them to particular records. **No information is shared until you explicitly choose to do so.**

For more information on using sharing policies see:
- [17.2.2 {{Project}} Sharing: Sharing {{Work}} Etc. Records](/help/index/p/17.2.2).
- [17.2.4 {{Project}} Sharing: Sharing Profiles](/help/index/p/17.2.4).
