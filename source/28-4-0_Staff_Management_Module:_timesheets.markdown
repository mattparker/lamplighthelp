# 28.4.0    {{Staff}} Management Module: Timesheets

> {{Staff}} timesheets are created based on the information recorded in the Contract details, Non contract, Absence, Training, Appraisals and {{Work}} records in their profile 

The timesheet table in each {{staff}} profile highlights how their time has been distributed over, and calculates the recorded hours against contracted ones. This information is not added directly to the sheet, but is drawn by {{Lamplight}} from Contract details, Non contract, Absence, Training, Appraisals and {{Work}} records.

The final row of information on the table calculates the total of each column. 

This table can be downloaded into a spreadsheet if required. To do this, click the 'Download data' link found at the bottom of the table.

If you have multiple {{project}}s you can choose whether timesheets are {{project}} specific or should be aggregated across all the {{project}}s {{people}} are involved in. To do this:

- In 'system administration', find the 'Customise Lamplight' box and click 'change global settings'.
- Choose the 'Staff module'tab
- There is a tickbox at the top of this page called 'Show timesheets combined across all projects?' Tick this if you would like to use the combined information. If you leave this unticked then the timesheet for each {{person}} will only show results from records in the {{project}} that you are in at the time.
