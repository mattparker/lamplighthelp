# 48.7 Accepting a profile submitted via the Publishing API or a widget

Profiles received by your system generally need to be checked and accepted into your system before you
start using them.

## Notification that a new profile has been added

When a new profile is added to your system via the publishing module, a notification will usually be created.
These are created as {{message}}s in the system, and assigned to whoever has been nominated to receive them
in the [publishing module settings](/help/index/p/134.2).

By default, profiles received through the publishing module are held for review before they can be used
in your system (this can be changed in the [settings](/help/index/p/134.2). You will need to check the
information in the profile and decide whether to accept it or not.

The easiest way to do this is click the name of the profile in the notification. This will open up their profile
as normal, but with an information banner.

You can view the different tabs as normal in the profile, but you will need to click 'accept' if you wish to add it
into your system.

## Dealing with duplicates

You may receive valid information for the same person more than once. You will want to combine these so that you 
don't end up with multiple profiles for the same person.

The [Merge duplicates](/help/index/p/108.1) tool will allow you to do this easily without losing any data.  
**You will need to 'accept' the profile first** so it can be merged.


## Rejecting referrals

If the data is invalid in some way - "Mickey Mouse" for example, you will need to reject the profile. Instead
of clicking 'accept', you will need to click 'archive'.

Your processes may differ if you have assessed the profile and are rejecting for reasons of eligibility, say.

## Viewing all profiles received

To view a list of all profiles received through the API, go to '{{People}}' on the main menu, and change the drop-down
to 'Profile added via publishing API', and click 'refresh data in table'.

From here you can click into the profile to view it as above, or use the actions menu and select 'Accept profile into system'.
