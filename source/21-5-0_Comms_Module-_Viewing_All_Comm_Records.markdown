# 21.5.0 {{Comm}}s Module: Viewing All {{Comm}} Records

> If you have the {{Comm}}s Module you can see a table of all the {{comm}}s sent or logged in your system




To view a list of all {{comm}}s records in {{Lamplight}}:

- Click on '{{Work}} -> View -> {{Comm}}s' on the main menu. 
- You will see the following screen:

![Viewing all {{comm}} records](90a.png)

This lists all {{comm}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown is set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual. For more on this see [16.4.3 Personal Settings: Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3).

### The Search Bar

To see more or fewer records, use the search bar:
- Click on the + icon on the search bar above the table to see more options. 
- Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.  

#### Restrict by date and work area.

You can set filters here so that you only see {{comm}}s records relation to a specific work area, period of time or location. You can also search for records edited by a specific staff member. The final box in this section allows you to show deleted records.

#### Additional data columns to display.

In this section you can add columns to the table to show {{people}} or {{org}}s who were listed in the recipients table of the {{comm}}s records, and for custom fields that you have on your records.

For more help on the tables see [section 3.5.3 to change columns and save layout](/help/index/p/3.5.3) of your table, and [section 3.5.4 to download it](/help/index/p/3.5.4).

### The Context Menu

You can see the context menu for a {{comm}} record by clicking on menu button in the left-hand column of the table, or right clicking on the record itself.  It has a number of options - these are the same as you will see in a {{comm}}s record in a profile - for more detail please see [21.4.0 The {{Comm}}s Tab](/help/index/p/21.4.0).
