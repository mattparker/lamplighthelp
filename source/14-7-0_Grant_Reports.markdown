# 14.7.0 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> {{Grant}} {{Report}}s

> With {{grant}} {{report}}s you can find information on the total, average value and number of {{grant}}s received in a specific time period



If you are using {{grant}} records in your system you can report on amounts received in time periods that you specify. You can present this {{report}} using {{workarea}}s or {{grant}} type, for example.

### {{Report}} Filters

To run a {{grant}} {{report}}:

- On the main menu click '{{report}}s -> more -> {{grant}}s {{report}}.
- You will see the {{report}} filters screen. 
- Most of the filters are the same as for other {{report}}s [see 13.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1).
- At the bottom you have the '{{Grant}} type' filter, which is specific to the {{grant}} {{report}}. The options that you see in the drop-down list will be specific to your system.

- If you do not choose to use any of the filters then your {{report}} will show all information. It is only when you pick an option that the information will be filtered.

### Additional Filters

- If you have any custom fields in your {{grant}} records you will see any that can be used as filters in the 'Additional filters' tab. You can use these to narrow down the information that is included in your {{report}}.

### {{Report}} Presentation

#### Row Data
  Choose what information you want to be in the rows of the {{report}} from this drop-down box. This includes fields from your {{grant}} records, such as {{workarea}}, {{grant}} type or custom fields, as well as demographic details from the funders' profiles. For example, you might choose to show the information split up by the {{workarea}} it was linked to:
  
  ![{{Grant}} {{Report}} Split by {{Workarea}}](13.7.0b.png)
  
#### Column Data and Data to Show
  You can also choose what information to show in your columns. For example, you may want to show how much was received from each {{grant}} type against your different {{workarea}}s. If you do this, you have to decide what type of data the {{report}} is showing:
  - Total value: the combined amount of the {{grant}}s.
  - Mean value: the mean average amount of the {{grant}}.
  - Number of {{grant}}s: how many grants recorded in the time specified.
  The example below shows total value of {{grant}}s.
