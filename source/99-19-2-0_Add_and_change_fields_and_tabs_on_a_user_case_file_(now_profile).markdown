# 19.2.0    Add and change fields and tabs on a user case file (now profile)

> Previously, you were unable to add fields or tabs to user profiles (which used to be called {{linked case}} files). We had to do it for you. The new version allows you to add tabs and fields of different sorts through the admin menu (see [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0)). 

You can add, edit, or delete tabs and fields on profiles: the new version allows you to do this through the admin menu (see section [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0) for details). 

Additionally, any fields you add will be available in automatic groups. And 'select' type fields will also be available in {{report}}s to cross-tabulate your {{report}} data.
