# 25.1.0 The Library Module: File Categories

> Setting up the Library Module for use is relatively simple - you just need to create some file categories. You will use these to categorise the contents of your library and as filters when searching. 

System Administrators can add categories for uploaded files, and these can be used to filter library searches.

**Setting Up File Categories**

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage drop-down lists’ section, under ‘Manage Library’, click ‘Add, edit and remove library categories’.
- Double-click where it says ‘double click to add’ to reveal a text field.
- Type the name of the category and save it by pressing the ‘Enter’ key.

**Editing a File Category**

Existing file categories can be edited from the same screen:
- Double-click the category in the list. 
- Type the new text and press ‘Enter’ to save.

**Changing the List Order**

- Click on the item that you would like to re-order, then drag and drop it where you would like it to go (left-click and hold the button down while you move your cursor to the new position, before releasing). 
- The other options will adjust to make space for it.

**Deleting a List Item**

- Find the item that you would like to delete in the list. 
- Drag it to the end of the list and drop it in the grey box labelled ‘Drag here to delete’. 

**Final Notes**

Once library categories have been created, the Library Module is ready to use.
