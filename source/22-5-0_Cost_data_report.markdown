# 22.5.0    Cost Data {{Report}}

> Cost data {{report}}s can be run to allow analysis of the cost involved in running activities, sessions or different interventions 

These {{report}}s are run via a {{work}} {{report}}.

To do this:

- On the {{report}}s section on the menu bar, click {{work}} -> {{report}}. 
- Go to the 'Report presentation' tab and from the 'data to show' option tick 'Cost data'. **Please note** This will override any selection that you have made in the 'Column data' drop-down.

The {{report}} will generate the following statistics:

- Mean cost per user attending - this is a 'cost per head' metric. This is calculated by taking the total cost for all {{work}} records included in the {{report}}, and dividing by the number of {{user}}s attending (i.e. Attendance type is 'attended' and Role is {{user}}).
- Mean cost per session - calculated by dividing the total costs incurred by the total number of {{work}} records included in the report.
- Total costs - the sum of the costs incurred.

If you wish to run a cost data {{report}} for a particular session or time frame for example, please use the {{report}} filters tab to select the {{work}} you wish to run the cost data on. 

Please see section [17.1.1  {{Report}} filters](/help/index/p/17.1.1) on {{report}} filters for more information on this and section [17.2.0  {{Work}} {{report}}](/help/index/p/17.2.0) for more information on {{work}} {{report}}s. 

You can also see the costs for a particular session of {{work}} by viewing the completed record (for more of viewing records see XXXXXXXXXXXXX).
