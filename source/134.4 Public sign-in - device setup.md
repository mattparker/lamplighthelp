# 134.4 Public sign-in - device setup

As a security measure, you need to register the devices you'll use for public sign-in,
because no login is required to access the sign-in page.

### Overview

The sign-in page is publicly accessible, without a password. That means that if you know or guess the URL, then access
to it means that you can see published {{work}} records, add people to them, and create new profiles in your system. To address this,
you need to register the device and browser that you'll use, and only registered devices can access the sign-in page. In
effect, registration gives the device a type of long-lasting password which works only for the sign-in page.

#### Viewing sign-in module settings

To view sign-in module settings, as a system administrator go to System Admin > Publishing module > Sign-in module
settings and device management. You will see a screen like this, where we have already registered one device:

![Sign-in module admin](134.4a.png)

The first section gives the URL for the sign-in page, and also a QR code version of the URL. Once you have registered a
device you need to
visit this URL to see the public sign-in page for today. This URL doesn't change for your system, so you can save it as
a favourite and refresh each day on the device without having to go into system admin.

The currently registered devices are listed, and by ticking the box you can de-register them. You should do this if the
device is stolen, or you suspect it's been tampered with, or it's no longer being used as a sign-in device. Click the '
update devices' button to de-register an existing device.

#### Registering a new device

To add a new device, enter a name for it. This is for your reference only, so give it a name that will mean you can tell
which device is which - perhaps add a brand name and model number, for example. Then click 'update devices'. You will
see a screen like this, showing a QR code and the URL it represents.

You now need the device you'll be using as the public sign-in device. Use its QR scanner (or transfer the URL by email
or something) to visit the registration URL. Make sure you're not logged in to Lamplight on the device you are
registering. When you do, Lamplight fdwill place an identifier (like a cookie) that will allow that browser on that device
to access the sign-in page. Other browsers won't work. You can now return to the device management page.

You can now visit the URL shown at the top of the sign-in module settings page on your registered device. But you'll
need some [{{work}} records set up appropriately](/help/index/p/28.5.2) to see anything useful.
