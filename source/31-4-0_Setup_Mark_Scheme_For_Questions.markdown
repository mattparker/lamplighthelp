# 31.4.0 Setup Mark Scheme for {{Recruiter}} Questions

> When shortlisting, panel members score each response from 1 to 5. A Mark Scheme identifies the
> elements of responses that would attract different scores, helping panel members while shortlisting.


To add or edit a Mark Scheme, you will need to [create a Question Set](/en/help/p/31.2.0) first.
Then, go to 'admin > system administration > {{Recruiter}} Module > Setup mark schemes for {{recruiter}} responses'.

You will see a list of Question Sets in your system.  Click on the name of the Question Set that you 
wish to change the mark scheme for.

You'll then see each question, with text boxes for your notes for each possible score for that question.
These notes are for the shortlisting panel only.

You don't have to add notes for every score point if you don't want to - add what's helpful for the panel.
You may wish to discuss these points with the panel.

If you change the questions, you will also need to update the Mark Scheme.
