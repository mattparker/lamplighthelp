# 23.0.0 The {{Eval}}s Direct Module

> The {{Eval}}s Direct Module allows your to ask your clients to fill out {{eval}}s online, inputting the data to {{Lamplight}} automatically

The {{Eval}}s Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, allowing you to create online links to your existing surveys/{{eval}}s.  You [create the templates](/help/index/p/22.1) as normal, and then create a 'campaign', where you ask a set of people to complete the survey online.

You have control over:

- presentation – use your logo and colour scheme
- anonymity – should responses be linked to profiles or not?
- who’s completing them, and when they can do so

You can report on a particular {{eval}} campaign, or on all answers for the same {{eval}} in a particular timeframe.

Using {{Lamplight}} you can send out one link to everyone, or choose to have a different link to each person so that you can track who has responded, and with what information.  Their answers are entered automatically into Lamplight, ready for your analysis.
