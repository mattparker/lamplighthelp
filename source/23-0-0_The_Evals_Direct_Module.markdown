# 23.0.0 The Data Direct Module

> The Data Direct Module allows to send your {{user}}s a link for them to complete your questionnaires/forms online. This can be with {{eval}}s or {{outcome}}s. When they fill it out the responses are automatically saved to {{Lamplight}}

The Data Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, allowing you to create online links to your existing surveys/{{eval}}s, as well as the core system {{outcome}}s. You [create the {{eval}} templates](/help/index/p/22.1) or [create the {{outcome}} templates](/help/index/p/16.6.2) as normal, and then create a 'campaign', where you ask a set of people to complete the survey online.

You have control over:

- presentation – use your logo and colour scheme
- anonymity (for {{eval}} campaigns – should responses be linked to profiles or not?
- who’s completing them, and when they can do so

With {{outcome}} campaigns, you can:

- have a different link for each person, so that you can track who has responded, and with what information
- have their responses entered automatically into Lamplight and displayed in their profile (table view or radar chart)

With {{eval}} campaigns, you can also:

- report on a particular {{eval}} campaign, or on all answers for the same {{eval}} in a particular timeframe.
- send out one link to everyone
