# 23.0.0 The {{Eval}}s Direct Module

> The {{Eval}}s Direct Module allows your to ask your clients to fill out {{eval}}s online so that you do not have to input the data for ones which have been completed



The {{Eval}}s Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, allowing you to create online links to your existing surveys/{{eval}}s.

You will have control over:

- presentation – use your logo and colour scheme.
- anonymity – should responses be linked to profiles or not?
- who’s completing them, and how long the online {{eval}} is open for.


You can report on a particular {{eval}} run, or on all answers for the same {{eval}} in a particular timeframe.

Using {{Lamplight}} you can send out one link to everyone, or choose to have a different link to each person so that you can track who has responded, and with what information.  Their answers are entered automatically into Lamplight, ready for your analysis.
