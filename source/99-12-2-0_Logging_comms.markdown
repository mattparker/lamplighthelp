# 12.2.0    Logging {{comm}}s

> The {{comm}}s module allows you to save details of {{comm}}s not created in {{Lamplight}} (e.g. phone calls) 

In some cases you may not want to create a document or email, but may need to record that a {{comm}} has happened - an email received, or a phone call, for example. The {{comm}}s module enables you to log details of {{comm}}s. To do so, go to {{work}} -> {{comm}} -> log on the main menu. A slightly different screen will appear:

![Logging a {{comm}}]({{imgpath}}89a.png)

Only the first tab is different: you can record the type, time and {{workarea}} the {{comm}} relates to. 

{{Comm}} logs don't have a duration in {{Lamplight}} so if your {{comm}} took time to complete (e.g. a telephone meeting or writing a detailed letter) then consider capturing it as a {{work}} record instead.
