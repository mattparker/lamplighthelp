# 7.1.4 {{Work}} Record: the 'Details' Tab

> The 'Details' tab is a place where you can add a text summary and notes of the session



The 'Details' tab allows you to add text information about the piece of work. 

 - The text that you add to the 'Summary' field is what appears in your home page diary and other summary listings of work. 
 - The 'Description' field is a text box which is usually used to enter notes on the detail of the session. If you're creating a record in advance, you may want to come back and fill this in later. 
 - The 'Follow-up' field is where you can keep a record of things that need to happen following the session. You may not need to use this.

When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right. 

There may be other custom fields to fill in on this page. These are unique to your organisation. If you do not know how to complete them, please ask your System Administrator.

If you'd like to see a demonstration of how to complete a work record, you can view our video ['Creating a Work Record'](/help/index/p/51.4.1).
