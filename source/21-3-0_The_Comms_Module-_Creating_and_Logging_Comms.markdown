# 21.3.0 The {{Comm}}s Module: Creating and Logging {{Comm}}s

> If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you have some added options so that you can not only send {{comm}}s, but also log ones which come back to you



### Creating {{Comm}}s

**To see more about creating a new {{comm}}, see [10.1.0 Creating a {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/10.1.0).**  This page shows the additional functionality available with the {{comm}}s module.

When you get to the 'Message content' tab, you will see some added options in the text editor bar:

#### People Mail Merge

The 'people merge' fields will insert information about the {{people}} that are to receive the {{comm}}. This information is taken from the data in their profile.

#### Document Templates

These are standard letters and emails (or parts of them) which are unique to your organisation, that any database operator can use - simply select the one that you want to use from the menu.  
   
See section [21.1.1 {{Comm}} Templates](/help/index/p/21.1.1) for more information about document templates and how System Administrators can set them up.

#### {{Activity}} Merge

If you have started the {{comm}} from an {{activity}} record ({{work}}, {{referral}} etc.), you will be able to use the '{{Activity}} merge options.  See [section 21.3.1](/help/index/p/21.3.1) for how to do this.

Using these fields will insert information from the {{activity}} record that you started with, for example the date, start and end times.  These fields only work if you create your {{comm}} from the {{activity}} record.

#### Image Library

Images for {{comm}}s are saved in their own library (see section [21.1.4 {{Comm}}s Module Image Library](/help/index/p/21.1.4)).  To insert one into your {{comm}}, go to the 'Image library' drop-down box and select the one you want from the menu.  Once you have inserted an image, you can edit it by double-clicking. This will open a window to alter the size and other characteristics.

### Logging {{Comm}}s  

In some cases you may not want to create a document or email, but may need to record that a {{comm}} has happened - an email received, or a phone call, for example.  To do this,

- Go to {{work}} -> {{comm}} -> log on the main menu. 
- A slightly different screen will appear:

![Logging a {{comm}}](89a.png)

In the first tab you can record the type of {{comm}}, time and {{workarea}} that it relates to. (It is possible to add types of {{comm}} to this list - for more see [21.1.2 {{Comm}}s Module: Types of Logged {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/21.1.2).

{{Comm}} logs don't have a duration in {{Lamplight}} so if your {{comm}} took time to complete (e.g. a telephone meeting or writing a detailed letter) then consider capturing it as a {{work}} record instead.  The remaining tabs are all filled out in the same way as you would complete a normal {{comm}} record.
