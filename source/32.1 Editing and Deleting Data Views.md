Data views are a way of viewing your data. Deleting them does not delete any of the data from your system.Â However, you should check whether a dataview is being being used by colleagues in profiles or elsewhere before deleting. If you are editing a dataview to show something different, be sure to update the Name and Description so it's still accurate.
