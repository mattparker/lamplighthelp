# 17 {{Comm}}s - Creating and Editing

A '{{comm}}' created within {{Lamplight}} is a letter, email or mailing labels. If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you may also be able to send SMS messages.

![17 {{Comm}}s - Creating and Editing - step 1](17_Communications_-_Creating_and_Editing_im_1.png)

When you send emails from Lamplight they will be set up in the system and then sent through your email server, so restrictions on number of emails and size of attachments that apply to your organisation's emails will still apply when using Lamplight. The ability to send emails through Lamplight, will depend on the security settings within your email provider. It is not always possible.

Before you can send emails through Lamplight your system or project administrator will need to set up your server details in system administration (for more information see 16.11.0 Setting Up Email).

You can create a {{comm}} from the main menu. This could be an email, letter or mailing labels
To create a new {{comm}} from the main menu:

1. Click on the Activity tab

3. You will see the first screen for creating {{comm}}s:

{{Work}} through each tab to add the information that you need. Some may be greyed out depending on the type of {{comm}} you are adding. You do not have to fill in every tab if it is not relevant. You may not want to attach a file for example.

Details on the different tabs are in the following pages:
- [17.1 Communication Type](/help/index/p/17.1).
- [17.2 Communication Recipients](/help/index/p/17.2).
