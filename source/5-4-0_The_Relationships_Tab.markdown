> Relationships link different {{people}} and {{org}}s in {{Lamplight}} together. A way of seeing connections they have to others in one table.



A {{person}} or {{org}} may have any number of relationships to others in the database. You can manage these in the 'Relationships' tab in the profile. 

For example, you may wish to record which people work with {{user}}s regularly, who their doctor is, their key worker, social worker, parole officer and other members of the family on the database or which other agencies, schools or partners are linked to them. You can record as many relationships as you need.

### Adding a Relationship

To add a new relationship:
- Go to the 'Relationships' tab in the profile, then click 'Add' at the bottom of the screen on the right.

- In the pop-up box which appears:
  - In the 'Find profile' box, begin typing the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} that you want to connect to the profile you are currently in. The live search will display the names of the profiles on the database which match the name you are typing. 
  - Select the name you want from the list.

  - Select the correct relationship from the 'Relation' drop-down box. This needs to clearly identify the reason these two profiles are connected. Please note, new options can be added to this list by in-house system administrators. The list can be made unique to your organisation and your system requirements.
  - If you are using default contacts in your system, the final option is to select whether you wish this {{person}} or {{org}} to be the default contact for the {{person}} or {{org}} you are linking them to. This may be appropriate if they are your main contact at a particular {{org}}, or for example a parent is the default contact for a child.
  - Below this there is a notes box where you can record any other details that you would like to be shown in the relationships table. 
  - The final option 'Relationship category' will only be visible if a system administrator has set up list items in advance. This is an option to further categorise the connection. This can be helpful if for example you're linking agencies connected to {{user}}s and you need to track if you've gained permission to share information with them or not, or you've a number of family members, but you need to categorise them in terms of suitability of contact.

### Editing a Relationship

Once the relationship has been saved the table in the tab will be updated. 

To edit an existing relationship:
- Click on the menu to the left of the relationship you need to change, or right click on it in the table.
- A context menu will pop up.

You can:
  - Move into the linked {{person}}'s profile by clicking 'view full details'.
  - Edit the relationship link.
  - Reverse the relationship. Relationships in {{Lamplight}} can be two way, for example you could have a Mentor (Mentee) relationship type. This would mean that one {{person}} is the mentor, and the other the mentee. (The actual relationship types that you have will be specific to your system). If the relationship is added the wrong way round, so in this instance the 'Mentor' would be showing as the 'Mentee' and vice versa, you can choose 'Reverse' to put this right.
  - Close relationship. This will move the relationship from the current table into the 'history'. 
  - Communicate. You will only see this option if you have the {{Comm}}s Module. It opens a new {{comm}} record to communicate with linked {{person}} (not with the {{person}} whose profile you are in).
  - Copy address details from ..... This is useful if you are adding someone who they lives/works at the same address - a family member or employee, for example. {{Lamplight}} will copy the address directly from the profile in the table to the {{person}} or {{org}} linked to them, updating the 'Contact details' tab immediately. Note - this action cannot be undone. 
  

### Relationship History

Below the relationships table, on the right-hand side of the screen next to the 'Add' button there is a 'View History' button. 

Clicking on this will show you all the {{people}} who have ever been set up with a relationship with the {{person}} in this profile. 

The 'Since' column will show you when the relationship was started, and the 'To' column when that relationship was closed. There will not be any 'To' date where it is a current relationship.

Click the 'View current' button on the right to return to the normal view.

You can see how this works in our ['Relationships' video](/help/index/p/51.2.4).
