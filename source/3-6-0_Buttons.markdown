# 3.6.0 Buttons

> Buttons on {{Lamplight}} pages do more than click - some have menus too



Many screens have buttons that allow you to do particular things: usually adding or editing information (normally the top right of the page) or saving it (normally the bottom right of the page/pop-up box). Just click the button.

Another type of button used in the system is a radio button. An example of these can be found in the first tab of a {{work}} record, for adding in {{workarea}}s.

You can only select one {{workarea}} at a time. When you have done this you'll see {{subworkarea}}s appear to the right.

You select {{subworkarea}}s by ticking the checkboxes next to them - you can select as many of these as you need.
