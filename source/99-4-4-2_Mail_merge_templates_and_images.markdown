# 4.4.2    Mail merge, templates and images

> When creating {{comm}}s you can use mail-merge and predefined document templates 

You can use mail merges within your {{comm}}s. The {{comm}} module also allows you to use document templates, insert images and use more complex merge fields. When creating {{comm}}s you will see the following buttons:

![Mail merge {{comm}}s]({{imgpath}}22a.png)

The 'people merge' fields will insert information about the {{people}} that are to receive the {{comm}}.

#### For people with the {{comm}} module

If you have the {{comm}}s module and you create a {{comm}} originating from a record, you will have the following additional buttons:

![Mail merge {{comm}} module]({{imgpath}}22b.png)

The 'happen merge' fields will insert information about the thing that happened ({{work}} record, {{outcome}} etc) to those people.  These fields will only work, of you have come to the communication record from the 'happening' ({{work}}, {{Referral}} record etc, of that type)

The document templates in the {{comm}} module, are standard letters (or parts of letters) that can be set up for the organisation as a whole. To use a template, simply select the name of the template from the menu. See section [18.8.0  {{Comm}} templates](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.8.0) for more information about document templates.

Images in this module are saved in the 'library' (see section [18.9.0  {{Comm}}s module image library](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.9.0)) and can be used at any time. To insert an image into your document just go to the image library drop-down box and select the one you want from the menu. 

Once you have inserted an image, you can edit it by double-clicking. This will open a window to alter the size and other characteristics.
