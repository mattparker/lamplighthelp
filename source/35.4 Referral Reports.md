# 35.4 Referral Reports

{{Referral}} {{report}}s allow you to count and summarise {{referral}}s within the timeframe you set

{{Referral}} {{report}}s collate information from your {{referral}} records. You can also use data from fields in profiles to show the results in different ways.  (For more on {{report}} presentation, see [14.1.4 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/14.1.4)). 


1. On the main menu click '{{Report}}s' at the top of the screen

![35.4 {{Referral}} {{Report}}s - step 1](35.4_Referral_Reports_im_1.png)

2. You will now see the {{report}}s landing page

From the {{referral}} {{report}} section, you have options of what to choose.
- You can create your own {{referral}} {{report}}, based on your own criteria. When you have run the {{report}}, you can save the data, and the {{report}} will close.
- You can run a {{report}} template. This is a {{report}} with the criteria pre-determined and set-up to be run whenever you want. Dates for {{report}} templates can be dynamic, for example, they will always show the previous quarter from when you run the {{report}}. Once you've run a {{report}} template you can change the criteria and presentation to show different results at that moment, without changing the template itself.
- If you are a System Adminstrator you'll also see the option to set-up new {{report}} templates.

To create a new {{referral}} {{report}} choose the option to create a 'New {{referral}} {{Report}} using your own criteria. This is an overview, and more details are available in the next pages.

4. Click on {{Report}} filtersâ€¦

Most of the filters are the same as for other reports (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)). The one significant different is in chosing the attendance role. To see profile referred, please choose the option '{{user}} referred', rather than {{user}}.

At the bottom you have filters for {{referral}} success and direction. The options within these will vary as they are lists which have been customised for your system to reflect the information you capture in {{referral}} records. If you do not choose anything from these fields, then your {{report}} will return information from records whatever their success or direction.

8. The {{report}} results table will display, scroll down to see more

- Number of {{referral}}s. This is the number of {{referral}} records between the dates selected.
- Number of {{people}} involved in {{referral}}s. This will show you the number of {{people}} in the attendance tables of these {{referral}} records. This will be affected by the 'Role' filter - if you have just chosen {{staff}}, for example, the number will relate only to the {{staff}} in those records.
- Number of different {{people}}. These are the unique individuals. If the same {{person}} has attended three separate {{referral}}s, they will be counted all three times in the 'Number of {{referral}}s' column, but only once in 'Number of different {{people}}.
