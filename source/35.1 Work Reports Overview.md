# 35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview

If you need to report on the amount of {{work}} that you have been doing, or on information about those attending {{work}} records, a {{work}} {{report}} is the place to start

A {{work}} {{report}} gives a numerical summary of information from your {{work}} records. They can show the number of:
- attendances
- unique individuals
- people hours
- sessions.


To start a {{work}} {{report}}
  
1. Click &#039;{{Report}}s&#039; from the main menu at the top of the screen

2. From {{work}} {{report}} box, you have option of what to choose.

- You can create your own {{work}} {{report}}, based on your own criteria. When you have run the {{report}}, you can save the data, and the {{report}} will close.
- You can run a {{report}} template. This is a {{report}} with the criteria pre-determined and set-up to be run whenever you want. Dates for {{report}} templates can be dynamic, for example, they will always show the previous quarter from when you run the {{report}}. Once you've run a {{report}} template you can change the criteria and presentation to show different results at that moment, without changing the template itself.
- If you are a System Adminstrator you'll also see the option to set-up new {{report}} templates.

To create a new {{Work}} {{report}} choose the option to create a 'New {{Work}} {{Report}} using your own criteria. This is an overview, and more details are available in the next pages.
