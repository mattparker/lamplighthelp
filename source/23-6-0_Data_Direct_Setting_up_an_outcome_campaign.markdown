# 23.6.0 {{Outcome}} Data Direct: Setting Up a Campaign

> A 'campaign' is the name of the template where you design the style, confirm the questionnaire and settings for the online form you wish to send.




Before you start, you will need the Data Direct Module enabled on {{Lamplight}}. This can be enabled by A campaign uses existing {{outcome}}s, new {{outcome}}s can be added to your system by in-house system administration (see [16.6.2 Outcomes](/help/index/p/16.6.2)).

### To Set Up {{Outcome}} Data Direct Campaigns

- In the main menu go to '{{work}} -> Data Direct -> {{outcome}} campaigns -> add'.
- You will see a screen like the one below.

![{{Outcome}} Direct campaign](23.6.0a.png)

You need to complete each section:
  
#### Campaign Details
   
   - Title for the campaign: choose a title which will allow you to identify it in future and explains the form used. Please note, this title will be seen by your recipients
   - Time and date: the start and finish define when the campaign will be available online for your invitees to complete. If they try outside of these times they will see a message telling them the campaign is closed.
   - {{Workarea}}: when responses return into {{Lamplight}}, you can choose which {{workarea}} they'll be tagged to. This enables you to use the same {{outcome}} for different services.
   - Select {{outcome}} category: this allows you to choose which {{outcome}} category you wish to use in your campaign. You can select more than one and re-order them by using your mouse and left-clicking and drag the boxes in the preferred order.

   - Do you want to add the {{outcome}} category label before the questions?: if you tick this box there will be a sub-heading on the final form. In the image above 'Health and Wellbeing' would appear as a heading before the questions started.

#### Invitees
   - Select the {{people}} you wish to complete the survey, in the same way that you would for other records ([Adding attendance 7.1.2](/help/index/p/7.1.2). Please note, additional {{people}} can be added to this campaign at a later date.

#### Text and Styling
   
   This tab is where you can customise the appearance, introduction and signoff of the survey.
  - Introductory text appears at the top of the screen before the survey.
  - Text to display at the bottom of the page will be added after the survey and before they commit their reply
  - Text to display after the information has been saved will be shown on a new page when the respondent clicks 'save'.
  - Style relates to the type of font used to display the survey. To confirm serif is a Times New Roman style font and sans-serif is similar to Arial.
  - Colour schemes will depend on what has been set up in your system. If your System Administrator has created new ones this is where you will find them - see [23.1 Data Direct Module: Set Up](/help/index/p/23.1).
  - Do you want your logo displayed? If you tick the box, you will need to have one loaded in System Admin for this to work - see [16.17.0 Adding or Changing Your Organisation Logo](/help/index/p/16.17.0).

#### Standard email template

The email text you enter here will be used to send the URL to people to ask them to complete the {{outcome}}s you've selected. You will need to enter the text here if you want to be able to quickly send invitations from within profiles, and we recommend that you do.

You **must** make sure that your email includes the **invitees url** mail merge field, as this is substituted for the individual URL when the email is sent.

You can use other merge tags here if you want to too, and we'd recommend that you do to personalise your email. If you are creating campaigns regularly you may want to create a {{comm}}s template to speed this up.
