# 12.2.3 Using Data Views to Create Headers

> You can set up {{group}} data views to use as header bars on profiles 

If there is information about {{people}} or {{org}}s held on {{Lamplight}} that you would like to see at the top of their profiles, you can use a data view to show this. It will appear just below the words ‘Profile for Name’.  

![Header](12.2.3a.png)

This is a personal setting, and needs to be set-up for individual {{user}}s.  However, you can copy one operator's personal settings to another user (see [16.5.2 System Administration - Adding a New Database Operator and Editing Operator Settings](/help/index/p/16.5.2) for more details.)

You will need to set up the data view before you can add it as a header bar (see [12.1.0 Creating {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/12.1.0).)

Once you have your data view:

- From the main menu, go to 'Admin -> System administration'.  
- In the section called ‘Customise Lamplight’ choose ‘change my personal settings'.
- Scroll down the page, until you see the bold title, ‘Profiles’, as shown below.

![Profile Header Options](12.2.3b.png)
 
In this section, you can choose either to set the same header for all profiles, or to choose a different data view for each type of profile.
- ‘{{Group}} data view to use in heading on profiles (default)’ will set this data view as the header on all profile types.
- If you want a to use a different data view for some profile types (so you can differentiate between {{staff}} and {{user}}s for example, you can choose different headers for different profiles in the following boxes. For example, ‘List data view to use in {{person}} – {{staff}} profiles’, will select the header you see when you view a {{staff}} profile.
- If you select a default option and the different data views for some of the other profile types, the default will show in all profiles which don’t have a different data view selected.

We have a video on this too!
