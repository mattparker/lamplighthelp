#  5.6.0 Archiving, Deleting and Restricted Processing of Profiles

> System Administrators can both archive and permanently delete profiles. They can also restrict the processing of data in a specific {{person}}'s account if there is a request for them to do so

Archiving of a profile allows for a {{person}} or {{org}} that has been involved in work to still be counted in reports. You can also run groups to show archived individuals and {{org}}s. They will not come up in the main search bar or search boxes in records, so they are not active on the system. 

If you permanently delete a profile this cannot be undone and the information you delete is gone.

Restricted processing is a particular right for data subjects under the GDPR. Where a data subject requests that the processing of their data be restricted, you can add restricted processing to their profile so that their profile can't be edited and they will not be included in any reporting. 

For more on each of these see:
