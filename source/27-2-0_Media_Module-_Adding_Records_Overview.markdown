# 27.2.0 Media Module: Adding Records Overview

> The Media Module allows you to attach files and link online media to your profiles, {{work}} and other records



You can store many types of file.

### Media Formats

You can upload any kind of file using the media module, although individual files have to be less than 10MB each. 

{{Lamplight}} will try to open the file to create a simple preview of the file to show, and optionally to index the content for searching. The types of file that previews can be generated for are:
- Word processing (.doc, .docx, .odt, .rtf).
- Pdfs (.pdf).
- Spreadsheets (.xls,, .xlsx, .ods, .csv).
- Powerpoint files (.ppt).

{{Lamplight}} will create thumbnails for images uploaded (in .jpg, .png, or .gif formats). You can also provide links to files elsewhere on the internet, and Lamplight will fetch them.
- Links to images on Flickr.
- Links to films on YouTube.

### The Security of Linking to External Sites

Whenever you view media on {{Lamplight}} that has been taken from an external website such as Flickr or YouTube, you will see that the padlock icon disappears from your address bar. This does not mean that your information is no longer safe. 

{{Lamplight}} is having to connect to another site in order to show you the media. If you upload the files directly into {{Lamplight}} rather than linking to them, you will not see the warning.

The security risk of this is no greater than viewing the image or video on Flickr or Youtube, but you should still be careful about where items come from and check that the Copyright restrictions enable you to use them.
