Options within the drop-down options can be customised by your system administrator. As you click inside the {{referral}} reason and {{referral}} notes section the rich text editor tools appear. See section [4.4.0  Rich text editor](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.4.0) for more information about using the rich text editor. If you have the {{waiting list}} module enabled, you will also see a drop-down listing all the current {{waiting list}}s. Select one to add the '{{user}} referred' to the {{waiting list}} at the same time. 

When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right. A copy of the {{referral}} record will be saved to the profile of everyone listed on the attendance tab.
