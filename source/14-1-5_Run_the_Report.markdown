# 14.1.5 Run the {{Report}}

> Once you have added the filters that you want to your {{report}}, click 'Run' at the bottom of any tab to get your data



Once you have set up the filters and {{report}} presentation that you need, click the 'run {{report}}' button at the bottom-right of any page. 

![Run the {{Report}}](13.1.5a.png)

This will take you back up to the top of the screen - scroll down again to see the {{report}}.

If it does not look as you expected it to, you can go back to modify your filters and presentation, then run it again.
