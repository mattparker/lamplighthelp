> Once you have added the filters that you want to your {{report}}, click 'Run' at the bottom of any tab to get your data



Once you have set up the filters and {{report}} presentation that you need, click the 'run {{report}}' button at the bottom-right of any page. 

![Run the {{Report}}](13.1.5a.png)

This will take you back up to the top of the screen - scroll down again to see the {{report}}.

If it does not look as you expected it to:
- you can go back to modify your filters and presentation, then run it again.
- click onto the results table to understand more. Some of the results tables allow you to click on the number to help you understand which records/profiles have been included in the report. For example if you're running a 'number of records' report, it will show you the dates of the records, if it's a 'number of profiles' report it will show you the names.

![Profile names](14.1.5b.png)

If you then need to explore the record or the profile further, use the 'Shift' key on your keyboard as you click with your mouse to open the record or the profile into a new browser window. Helpful so you don't move away from your report as you understand your results.
