# 21.5.0 Viewing All {{Comm}} Records

> If you have the {{Comm}}s Module you can see a table of all the {{comm}}s sent or logged in your system


To view a list of all {{comm}}s records in {{Lamplight}}:

- Click on '{{Work}} -> View -> {{Comm}}s' on the main menu. 
- You will see the following screen:

![Viewing all {{comm}} records](90a.png)

- This lists all {{comm}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown is set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual. For more on this see [16.4.3 Personal Settings: Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3).

### The Search Bar

- Click on the + icon on the search bar above the table to see more options. 
- Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.  
   - **Restrict by date and work area.**
   You can set filters here so that you only see {{comm}}s records relation to a specific work area, period of time or location. You can also search for records edited by a specific staff member. The final box in this section allows you to show deleted records.
   - **Additional data columns to display.**
   In this section you can add columns to the table to show {{people}} or {{org}}s who were listed in the recipients table of the {{comm}}s records, and for custom fields that you have on your records.

### Saving Your View

- Right-click on the header bar of the table to see a list of all the standard columns.  Ones that are ticked are showing already, and unticked columns are hidden.  You can change this by clicking on the item you wish to show or hide. 
- If you wish to make your changes the default view, choose 'save table columns layout' from the list. (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, these can also be saved.) This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.

- Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the default table view.  

### Downloading and Printing the Table

- To download the table information into a spreadsheet, click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table. Make sure that you have all the information showing on one page before you do this, as only the information you can see will be downloaded. 
   - To do this, click on show 'All' in the dropdown box above the table.

- Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose. For example, if you choose 'Date' emails will be grouped into separate tables based on the date that they were recorded in the system. Each table opens in a separate tab. 

### The Context Menu

- You can see the context menu for a {{comm}} record by clicking on menu button in the left-hand column of the table, or right clicking on the record itself.
- It has a number of options - these are the same as you will see in a {{comm}}s record in a profile - for more detail please see [21.4.0 The {{Comm}}s Tab](/help/index/p/21.4.0).
