# 16.0.0 System Administration

> System administration allows you to set up and change the settings on your {{Lamplight}} system. This is where you can alter drop-down lists, add new database operators, and manage many other aspects of your system

{{Lamplight}} database operators with a System or Project Administrator level of access have permission to make many changes in Lamplight. If you do not have this level of access, you will see a more limited range of options in system administration. 

To view the system administration page, click 'admin' on the main menu, then choose 'system administration.'

The main functions that an administrator can perform are:

- Adding new database operators to the system, assigning the appropriate user level and deleting them where necessary (see [16.5.0 Database Operators](/help/index/p/16.5.0)).
- Adding to or changing the drop-down lists that appear in {{Lamplight}} in profiles and records (see [16.6.0 System Administration: Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0)).
- Creating new custom tabs and fields on profiles and records (see [16.7.0 Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/16.7.0)).
- Setting login and password policies for users (see [16.5.5 Login Security Policies](/help/index/p/16.5.5)).
- Turning features - such as {{message}}s and {{linked case}}s - on and off in global settings (see [16.12.0 Changing Global Settings](/help/index/p/16.12.0)).
- Creating {{report}} and {{activity}}s templates that are available to all users (see [16.9.0 Creating {{Report}} Templates](/help/index/p/16.9.0) and [16.10.0 Creating {{Activity}} List Templates](/help/index/p/16.10.0)).
- Uploading profile data (see [16.3.0 Uploading Profile Data to {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/p/16.3.0)).
- Merging and permanently deleting profiles (see [16.8.0 Working with Profiles](/help/index/p/16.8.0)).
