# 16.0.0    System Administration

> System administration allows you to set up and change the settings on your {{Lamplight}} system. This is where you can alter drop-down lists, add new database operators, and manage many other aspects of your system. 

{{Lamplight}} database operators with a system or project administrator level of access have permission to make many changes in their system. If you do not have this level of access, you will see a more limited range of options in system administration. 

To view the system administration page, click 'admin' on the main menu, then choose 'system administration.'

The main functions that an administrator can perform are:

- adding new users to the system, assigning the appropriate user level and deleting them where necessary
- adding to or changing the drop-down lists that appear in {{Lamplight}}
- creating new custom tabs and fields on profiles and records
- setting login and password policies for users
- turning features - such as {{message}}s and {{case}}s - on and off in global settings
- creating report and {{activity}}s templates that are available to all users
- uploading profile data
- merging and permanently deleting profiles.
