# 3.9.0    Hiding information

> Some things are hidden on screen until you need them: click the + sign to show them 

Sometimes information is hidden until you need it, to leave room on the screen. Instead, you will see a bar with a label, and a small '+' icon on the right. Just click the '+' icon to view the hidden information.

This happens when you are viewing lists of records, or with text editors.
