# 16.5.0  <i class="fas fa-address-card"></i> System Admin - Database Operators

> Database operators are the people that have access to {{Lamplight}}. System Administrators set them up on the system, and decide what level of access they will have



This section covers

- [16.5.1 Operator Permission Levels](/help/index/p/16.5.1).
- [16.5.2 Adding a New Database Operator](/help/index/p/16.5.2).
- [16.5.3 Resetting a Database Operator's Password](/help/index/p/16.5.3).
- [16.5.4 Deleting a Database Operator](/help/index/p/16.5.4).
- [16.5.5 Login Security Policies](/help/index/p/16.5.5).
- [16.5.6 Password Policies](/help/index/p/16.5.6).

It is important to keep up to date with who your database operators are. If a member of staff leaves your organisation, for example, they will retain access to the system until you either lock their account or delete them as a database operator.
