# 16.5.0 System Admin - Database Operators

> Database operators are the people that have access to {{Lamplight}}. System Administrators set them up on the system, and decide what level of access they will have

It is important to keep up-to-date with who your database operators are. If a member of staff leaves your organisation, for example, they will retain access to the system until you either lock their account or delete them as a database operator.
