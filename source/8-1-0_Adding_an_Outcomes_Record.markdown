# 8.1.0 <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i>  Adding an {{Outcome}}s Record

> There are a number of different places that you can add {{outcome}} records for your {{user}}s. If you want to open the whole {{outcome}}s record, you can do this from the main menu, profile or the context menu of a {{work}} record



You can add scores, comments and details for a number of outcome measures in one go. Although like all {{activity}} records, {{outcome}}s are stored centrally, you can get to them in a number of different places.

#### From the Main Menu

Choose '{{Activity}} -> add new -> {{outcome}}:

#### In the '{{Outcome}}s' Tab of a Profile

Click on the 'Add' button on the right of the page:

#### In a {{Work}} Record Context Menu

Choose 'Add {{outcome}}s' (for more on {{work}} record context menus see [7.2.0 Viewing {{Work}} Records for an Individual](/help/index/p/7.2.0) and [7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0)): 

![Adding an {{Outcome}} from the {{Work}} Record Context Menu](8.1.0c.png)

Please note, this option is only available when using the attendance table, and not the simple search option (tab referenced as 'Respondent') as mentioned in [8-1-2_Adding_{{Outcomes}}-_Attendance](/help/index/p/8.1.2).

Only one {{user}} can be added to a simple respondent box. Once you've moved away from the original {{work}} record there is not a connection to the other {{user}}s.

If you do open the {{outcome}} record from here it will automatically add the same time and date, {{workarea}}, {{user}}s and {{staff}} (if using the 'attendance' tab) as are entered in the {{work}} record. You will need to remember to change these as necessary.  

We would advise that you only use this if there is a single {{user}} attending the {{work}} record. It is only possible to record one set of results per {{outcome}} record, and it is unusual that two {{user}}s would have exactly the same results. 

### Adding Outcome Scores through the Outcomes Tab

It is also possible to add {{outcome}} scores to an individual through the {{Outcome}}s tab in their profile. Please see:
- [8.1.5 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Radar Chart](/help/index/p/8.1.5)
- [8.1.6 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Advanced Table](/help/index/p/8.1.6)

For a demonstration of adding {{outcome}}s, [why not see our video](/help/index/p/51.5.1)?
