# 27.0.0 The Media Module

> The Media Module is a way to store documents, pictures and video content about your work and {{users}}

The Media Module lets you add pictures, video, and other files to your records in Lamplight. You may want to upload referral forms, a video of a session or photos of users, for example, or to link to photos on Flickr and Youtube videos.

Files can be attached to profiles, or to {{work}} and other records.

You can preview your uploaded files – including many document formats – and download them. You can also choose to add them to {{Lamplight}}’s main search index so you’ll be able to search for them using the main search bar later.

The Media Module comes with 5GB of storage per project. A System Administrator can view the amount of storage used and increase this as required.
