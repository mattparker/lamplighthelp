# 9.2.11    Add {{outcome}}s for {{people}} attending a {{work}} record

> Create a new {{outcome}} record for everyone attending by clicking 'add {{outcome}}s' on the context menu. 

To add {{outcome}}s for everyone attending a {{work}} record, click 'add {{outcome}}s' on the context menu. This will open a popup window allowing you to enter {{outcome}}s for everyone attending the {{work}} record. Note that everyone will have the same {{outcome}} if you enter them in this way - a good way to enter outcomes such as standard baseline information, or completion of a training course.
