# 12.3.0    Viewing all {{comm}} records

> To see all {{comm}}s sent or logged, click view -> all -> {{comm}}s on the main menu. 

{{Comm}}s are only stored if you have the {{comm}}s module enabled.

To view a list of all {{comm}}s records, click on '{{Work}} -> View -> {{Comm}}s' on the main menu. You will see the following screen:

![Viewing all {{comm}} records]({{imgpath}}90a.png)

This lists all {{comm}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown, can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual.  We recommend speaking to your system administrator before making changes.

__Restrict by date and work area__

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the search bar or the '+' icon on the right of the search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.  You'll now see a second bar displayed named 'Additional data columns to display.'

__Display additional columns__

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Clicking on here will allow you to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your work records.

__Saving your view__

You can adjust the columns shown in the table, by right clicking in the headings row of the table.  This will show you a list of rows.  Ticked rows are shown, and unticked rows are hidden.  You can change this by clicking on the item you wish to show or hide. If you wish to make that change the default view, click again and from the bottom of the pop-up list, choose 'Save table columns layout'.  This will now be shown as the default view for you.  This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the system standard.  (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, these can also be saved.)

__Downloading and printing the table__

If you wish to download the information you have searched for into a spreadsheet, click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table'.  Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose.

__The context menu__

The context menu for the table has a number of options: right-click on a row of the table or use the menu button to see these. Some will be disabled, depending on the {{comm}} record and your permission level within the system.
