# 28.3.2 Publishing Module: Publishing {{Work}} Records

> To assist in publicising your events and advertising the services you offer to a wider audience, the publishing module can share your  {{work}} record information with your public-facing site 

If your settings allow {{work}} records  to be published, this does not happen by default. Each record individual record needs to be shared separately. This is to ensure that confidential information isn’t accidently published.

As part of the system setup your system administrator will have decided whether {{work}} records should be published, and if they are which fields within the record should be included. For example, you may want to publish the start and end time but not the description of the event (see section [28.2.0 Publishing Module: Settings in System Administration](/help/index/p/28.2.0)).

You can choose to publish either when you’re adding a new record or you can editing an existing one to allow this. 

### To Publish a {{Work}} Record

- If the record you want to publish doesn't already exist, you will need to start by creating a new one (see section [7.1.0  Adding a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.0) for more information).
- If it is an existing record, find it and open it to edit (see [7.3.0 Viewing all {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0)).
- Complete the necessary details in the 'When and where', 'Attendance' and 'Details' tab.
- Go to the 'Publishing' tab. You will see these options:

- **Publish this record via Lamplight API?**
   Allows the individual record to be published.
   
- **Title of the record for publishing**
   Give the record a title, which you can use when publishing.
   
- **Do you want to allow the addition of attendees through the Lamplight API?**
   This will allow people to add themselves to an activity through your site or app, if it is configured to do so.
   
- **Maximum number of clients allowed?**
   If people can add themselves to the record through your site, this sets a maximum number who will be accepted.


### To Edit and Remove Sharing from a {{Work}} Record

- Find the record and choose 'edit' on the context menu (see section [7.2.1  Edit a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.2.1)).
- Edit any of the fields that you would like to change.
- If you want to stop sharing this record, untick the checkbox next to 'Publish this record via {{Lamplight}} API?'
- Save your changes.
