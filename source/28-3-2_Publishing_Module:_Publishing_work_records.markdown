# 28.3.2 Publishing Module: Publishing {{Work}} Records

> To assist in publicising your events and advertising the services you offer to a wider audience, the publishing module takes your {{work}} record information and allows it to be shared with your public facing site. 

Work records are set-up so that they are not published by default. This is to ensure that confidential information isn’t accidently published.

As part of the system set-up your system administrator will have decided firstly, whether any {{work}} records should be published and secondly which fields within the record can be published - you may want to publish the start and end time, but not the description of the event for example (see section [24.5.0  System Administration - publishing module](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.5.0)).

You can choose to publish them either when you’re adding a new record or by going to in edit an existing one. 

### To Publish a {{Work}} Record

- If this record doesn't already exist, you will need to start by creating a new one and completing it in full (see section [9.1.0  Adding a {{work}} record](/help/index/p/9.1.0) for more information).
- If it is an existing record, find it and open it to edit (see XXXXXXXXX).
- Go to the 'Publishing' tab. You will see these options:

xxxxxx Picture here xxxxxx

   **Publish this record via Lamplight API?**
   
   - Allows the individual record to be published.
   
   **Title of the record for publishing**
   
   - Give the record a title, which you can use when publishing.
   
   **Do you want to allow the addition of attendees through the Lamplight API?**
   
   - This will allow people to add themselves to an activity or even through your site or app, if it is configured to do so.
   
   **Maximum number of clients allowed?**
   
   - If people can add themselves to the record through your site, this sets a maximum number who will be accepted.


### To Edit and Remove Sharing from a {{Work}} Record

- Find the record and choose 'edit' on the context menu (see section [9.2.2  Edit a {{work}} record](/help/index/p/9.2.2)).
- Edit any of the fields that you would like to change.
- If you want to stop sharing this record, untick the checkbox next to 'Publish this record via {{Lamplight}} API?'
- Save your changes.
