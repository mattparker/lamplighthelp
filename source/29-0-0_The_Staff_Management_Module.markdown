# 29.0.0 The Staff Management Module

> The Staff Management Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information for staff and volunteers



The Staff Management Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information, generate and report on timesheets and track staff development. Using a hierarchy, only those in the management line can view the staff management information in colleagues' profiles. The hierarchy can be altered over time to reflect changes in roles and staffing.

The tabs for the module appear within each staff member's profile. They are labelled:

- Timesheet: this shows hours worked, absence, and non contact time, comparing them to contracts hours. The timesheet information is created automatically using information gathered in {{work}} and non-contact records. 
- Contract details: you can keep details of current and past contracts held with your organisation.
- Non contact: this is where you can keep details of non-contact work undertaken, for example planning or follow-ups.
- Absence: you can log sickness or annual leave, including an annual leave calculator.
- Training log: to keep records of training undertaken.
- Appraisal record: for your records of supervision, 1:1 discussions and annual appraisal.

The staff module also provides information for the [Charge Module](/help/index/p/20.2.8) and [Expense Module](/help/index/p/24).
