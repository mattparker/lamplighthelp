# 35.7 The {{Linked case}} {{Report}} Results Table

The results table for {{linked case}} shows you a lot of information, and it's important to fully understand what you're looking at. 

1. To see the results table, run a {{linked case}} {{report}} to see {{report}} results table

2. If in {{report}} presentation you choose to group your result by {{linked case}} then your results table will show a  {{linked case}} per row, and will show statistics for that {{linked case}} in the row. These are the columns available to you:

- {{Linked case}} ID: Unique ID given to every {{Linked case}}
- {{Linked case}}: {{Linked case}} Name manually given to every {{Linked case}}
- Date {{linked case}} opened: Date the {{linked case}} is opened
- {{Linked case}} open: Shows if the {{linked case}} is open or closed (Yes and No)
- Date {{linked case}} closed: If the {{linked case}} is closed, the date closed will show here
- Length of {{linked case}} (weekdays): How long the {{linked case}} has been open for counting only weekdays
- Length of {{linked case}} (days): How long the {{linked case}} has been open for in days
- Summary time spent: Total length of time of all {{activity}} records within the {{linked case}}
- Number of {{work}} records in period: Number of {{work}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{outcome}} records in period: Number of {{outcome}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{comm}} records in period: Number of {{comm}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{referral}} records in period: Number of {{referral}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{eval}} records in period: Number of {{eval}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters

If you instead choose in {{report}} presentation to group your results by some other feature of the case, for example a case category or case field, your results table will look a little different.

This will {{group}} each {{linked case}} (for example) category per row, and will add all {{linked case}}s with that category together and give you the results. If you've chosen a category for example, your columns will be a summary of each category.

- {{Linked case}} category: Each category will show per row
- Number of {{linked case}}s open during the period: Number of {{linked case}}s in the category which were open at some point during the date range
- Number of {{linked case}}s opened during the period: Number of {{linked case}}s in the category which were opened during the date range
- Number of {{linked case}}s still open now: Number of {{linked case}}s in the category open today
- Number of {{linked case}}s that are closed now: Number of {{linked case}}s in the category closed today
- Number of {{linked case}}s closed during the period: Number of {{linked case}}s in the category which were closed during the date range
- Total days the {{linked case}}s were open for: Total days all {{linked case}}s in category where open for
- Total time spent on records in the {{linked case}}s (all dates): Total time of all {{activity}} in {{linked case}}s in category
- Total days {{linked case}}s have been dormant: Number of days from last {{activity}} record to today
- Number of {{work}} records in period: Number of {{work}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{outcome}} records in period: Number of {{outcome}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{comm}} records in period: Number of {{comm}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{referral}} records in period: Number of {{referral}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters
- Number of {{eval}} records in period: Number of {{eval}} records in the {{linked case}} which are within the date range and other {{report}} filters

Understanding the numbers you see in the different columns in the {{reports}}s table.

The numbers you see in each row, show you the total number, from whatever criteria you have chosen, for example, {{linked case}} categories. Being certain of what you are looking at will ensure you get the information you need.
- If you are {{report}}ing (filtering) on all open {{linked case}}s in a period, and are looking at the colummn for the number of {{linked case}} closed, the number you are looking at will be: Of all the {{linked cases}} open in this period, how many were closed. As a {{linked case}} is by definition open before it's closed, this will show you all closed {{linked case}} in this period.
- If though you are {{report}}ing (filtering) on newly opened casess within the period, then in the column for the number of {{linked case}}s closed, the number you are looking at will be: Of all the newly opened cases in the period, how many were closed within the period. This means the number you see will be a sub-set of the total {{linked case}}s closed in that period, and so may be different that the total number closed.

Being aware of the criteria you are {{report}}ing on when looking at columns offering different information to that criteria will help you be certain of the numbers you are looking at.
