# 16.8.2 Archiving Profiles

> System administrators and managers can archive a profile once it is no longer active and you don't need to add information to it or amend information that is already in it

Archiving is straightforward and reversable. When a profile is archived, it can still be counted in reports (if the ‘Include archived profiles?’ field is selected on the report filters page - for more on this see XXXXXXXXXXXX), but will not be included in {{group}}s. The profile itself will not be visible and it cannot be searched for using the search box at the top right of the page. 

**Archiving a profile**

- Open to the profile to be archived.
- Click the ‘Archive’ button in the top, right-hand corner.

- Select ‘unarchive’.
