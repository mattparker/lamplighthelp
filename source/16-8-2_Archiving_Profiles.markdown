# 16.8.2 Archiving Profiles

> System Administrators and Managers can archive a profile once it is no longer active and you don't need to add information to it or amend information that is already in it

Archiving is straightforward and reversable. When a profile is archived, it can still be counted in reports (if the ‘Include archived profiles?’ field is selected on the report filters page, (for more on this see [13.1.1 Report Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1)), and you can also run {{group}}s of archived {{people}} and {{Org}}s. The profile itself will not be visible, and it will not be found if you use the search box at the top of the screen, or search boxes for attendance tables in {{activity}} records.  

**Only database operators with a Manager level of access to {{Lamplight}} or above will be able to archive, find, and unarchive profiles.**

### Archiving a Profile

- Find the profile to be archived.
- Click the ‘Archive’ button in the top right-hand corner.

### Finding Archived Profiles

- Click {{people}} in the main menu.
- Move your cursor over the relevant profile role and select ‘all’.

### Finding an Archived Profile through the Duplicate Warning

- When you create a new profile you may receive a warning of possible duplicates already on the system. Lamplight checks new profiles against those with similar names to the one you're entering, and that includes archived profiles.

- If you see that the profile you're adding is already on the system, click on their name in the duplicates table to open the profile. 
- **If you do not unarchive this profile, it will be possible to add information to it (including personal information and {{activity}} records), but it will not be possible to find them again when using the search box at the top of the page. 

For more on this see [5.2.1 Creating Duplicate Profiles](/help/index/p/5.2.1).

### Unarchiving an archived profile

- Find the archived profile (see above), and open it.
- Click the ‘unarchive’ button to the top right of the screen.
