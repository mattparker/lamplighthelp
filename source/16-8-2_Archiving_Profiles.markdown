# 16.8.2   <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Archiving Profiles

> System Administrators and Managers can archive a profile once it is no longer active if you don't need to add information to it or amend information that is already in it

<<<<<<< HEAD


Archiving is straightforward and reversable. When a profile is archived it can still be counted in {{report}}s (if the ‘Include archived profiles?’ field is selected on the report filters page, (for more on this see [13.1.1 Report Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)). You can also run {{group}}s of archived {{people}} and {{org}}s. The profile itself will not be found if you use the search box at the top of the screen, or search boxes for attendance tables in {{activity}} records.

- Click 'Fetch data' and {{Lamplight}} will show a table of all the archived {{people}} of that role type.

### Finding an Archived Profile through the Duplicate Warning

When you create a new profile you may receive a warning of possible duplicates already on the system. Lamplight checks new profiles against those with similar names to the one you're entering, including archived profiles.

- If you see that the profile you're adding is already on the system, click the name in the duplicates table to open the profile.
- If you want to reinstate this profile (i.e. you are going to be adding data and records to it), click on 'unarchive' at the top right of the profile. 

**If you do not unarchive this profile, it will be possible to save information to it (including personal information and {{activity}} records), but as it will still be archived it will not be possible to find it using the search box at the top of the page.** 

For more on this see [5.2.1 Creating Duplicate Profiles](/help/index/p/5.2.1).
