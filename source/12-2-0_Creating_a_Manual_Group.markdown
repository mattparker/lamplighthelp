# 12.2.0 Creating a Manual {{Group}}

> Manual {{group}}s can be used when there is a set of people who have nothing particular to link them in {{Lamplight}}. You may want to group them for a mailing list, for example



To create a new manual {{group}}, go to '{{Group}}s -> Add -> Add manual {{group}}' on the main menu.

You will see the following screen:

### {{Group}} Name Tab

- The name and description are both required fields which has to be filled in before the {{group}} will save.
- Add a name and description of the {{group}} which will help you and other users of the system remember what it is for. The {{group}} will be available for other operators who have access to your system.
- If it is important that you are the only person who can add and remove people from the {{group}}, tick the 'lock this {{group}} for editing' box. That way you can be sure it hasn't changed without you knowing.

### {{Group}} Members Tab

- In the search box, start typing the name of the {{person}}, {{org}} or {{family}} you wish to include in your {{group}}. A drop-down box will appear showing all matches. 
- If the name you want to add is not on the list, keep typing until it appears. 
- Once you see it in the list, click on it to add them to the table.
- To remove someone from the list, click the red cross in the right-hand column of the table: you will be asked if you are sure. If you are, click 'OK' and they will be removed from the table and the {{group}}.

When you have added all the {{people}} you want in your {{group}}, click the 'save' button at the bottom-right of the page.

- Go the '{{Group}}s' Tab on their profile.
- Click the 'Add' button on the right of the page.
- You'll see a list of current manual {{group}}s - tick or untick the boxes to add or remove the {{person}} from them.
