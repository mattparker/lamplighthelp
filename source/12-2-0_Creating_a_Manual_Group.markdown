# 12.2.0  <i class="fa fa-users"></i> Creating a {{Manual group}}

> {{Manual group}}s can be used when there is a set of people who have nothing particular to link them in {{Lamplight}}. They may be members of a committee, for example.



To create a new {{manual group}}, go to '{{Group}}s -> Add -> Add manual {{group}}' on the main menu.

You will see the following screen:

### {{Group}} Name Tab

- The name and description are both required fields which has to be filled in before the {{group}} will save.
- Add a name and description of the {{group}} which will help you and other users of the system remember what it is for. The {{group}} will be available for other operators who have access to your system.
- If it is important that you are the only person who can add and remove people from the {{group}}, tick the 'lock this {{group}} for editing' box. That way you can be sure it hasn't changed without you knowing.

### {{Group}} Members Tab

- In the search box, start typing the name of the {{person}}, {{org}} or {{family}} you wish to include in your {{group}}. A drop-down box will appear showing all matches. 
- If the name you want to add is not on the list, keep typing until it appears. 
- Once you see it in the list, click on it to add them to the table.
- To remove someone from the {{group}}, click the red cross in the right-hand column of the table and the name will be removed

When you have added all the {{people}} you want in your {{group}}, click the 'save' button at the bottom-right of the page.

### Adding Members after the {{group}} is created

You can edit the manual {{group}} via the main menu bar ([see section 12.6](/help/index/p/12.6)) to either update the name/description of the {{group}} or to adjust the {{group}} members table.

You can also add/remove a profile on a manual {{group}} from within their profile. 
- Go the '{{Group}}s' Tab on their profile.
- Click the 'Add' button on the right of the page.
- You'll see a list of current manual {{group}}s - tick or untick the boxes to add or remove the {{person}} from them.
