Every Lamplight system has a suite of {{report}}s available for the core functions. These are available on all systems so long as they have been chosen in Global Settings (for more information seeÂ [114.2 Global Settings: Data to Store](/help/index/p/114.2)).

The core {{report}}s are:
- [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.1).
- [35.3 {{Outcome}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.3).
- [35.4 {{Referral}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.4).
- [35.6 {{Linked Case}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.6).
- [35.8 {{Grant}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.8).

If your Lamplight system has modules then you will be able to run further {{report}}s on these.

The module {{report}}s are:

- [35.10 The Communications Report](/help/index/p/35.10): this counts and presents information on {{comm}}s made.
- [35.12 The {{Eval}} {{Report}}](/help/index/p/35.12): this summarises responses to {{eval}} questionnaires.
- [35.14 {{Volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/35.14): this shows the number of {{volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}}s made and matched.
- [35.16 {{Staff}} Timesheet {{Report}}](/help/index/p/35.16): this breaks down how {{staff}}/{{volunteer}} time is spent, as captured via the {{Staff}} Management Module. 
- [35.17 {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}](/help/index/p/35.17): this shows the number of {{people}} on {{waiting list}}s, and average waiting times.
