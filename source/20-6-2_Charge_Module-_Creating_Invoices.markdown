# 20.6.2 Charge Module: Creating Invoices

> You can choose whether to create one invoice at a time from profiles, or to create batch invoices for a number of {{people}} or {{org}}s  at once



### Creating Batch Invoices

- Go to 'admin -> finances -> create invoices'.

- You will see a list of all the charges allocated.

- To create invoices, select some or all of the items in the table by ticking the checkbox in the left-hand column. You can select them all by clicking the header at the top of the table. 
- At the base of the table, click the 'create invoices' button.

- You will then see a form allowing you to set certain information for the invoice: what you add here will appear on every invoice created.

- When you are ready, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right hand corner. You will then see a confirmation message, and be able to download a .csv file containing this invoice information, ready to import into your accounting software.

### Creating Individual Invoices from the Profile 

- Open the profile of the {{person}} or {{org}} whose invoices you would like to create.
- Select the relevant table rows using the tickboxes.
- Click the 'batch for invoicing' button.

- This will open a form to where you can add additional invoice information. 
- When you have finished click 'save'. This creates invoice details as specified, and prepare an export file that you can use to import into your accounting software. {{Lamplight}} does not create printable invoices itself; it is better to do this within your existing accountancy software.
