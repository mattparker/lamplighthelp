2. The {{report}} will show under the &#039;run {{report}}&#039; button
If it does not look as you expected it to, you can go back to modify your filters and presentation, then run it again.

- Some of the results tables allow you to click on the number to help you understand which records/profiles have been included in the report.
- For example if you're running a 'number of records' {{report}}, it will show you the dates of the records, if it's a 'number of profiles' {{report}} it will show you the names.
- To see if you can click on a number, you can either try clicking on it, or if you hover your mouse over the number, if it's clickable the cusrsor icon will change to a hand icon.
