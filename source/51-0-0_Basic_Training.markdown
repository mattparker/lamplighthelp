# 51.0.0 Basic Training

> Basic Training is a collection of videos aimed at new staff, to give them an understanding of how information is recorded in Lamplight



These videos are split into sections so that you can skip bits that are not relevant to your organisation's processes. However, to get the most out of them we recommend that you view them in order â€“ later videos build on the information contained in earlier ones. 

They can also be viewed individually by people who need a refresher in a particular aspect of the system.

The sections for the Basic Training Videos are:

- [51.1.0 The Homepage and Diary](/help/index/p/51.1.0).
- [51.2.0 Profiles](/help/index/p/51.2.0).
- [51.3.0 {{Referral}}s](/help/index/p/51.3.0).
- [51.4.0 {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/51.4.0).
- [51.5.0 {{Outcome}}s](/help/index/p/51.5.0).
