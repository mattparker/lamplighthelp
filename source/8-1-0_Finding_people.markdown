# 8.1.0    Finding {{people}}

> Use the search bar on the top right-hand corner of your screen to find a profile quickly. 

There are a number of ways to find a particular {{person}}. The easiest way is to use the search bar in the top-right corner of your screen. As you start typing, the system will search the database for {{people}} with similar names (the search only starts after you've typed 3 letters). You can also search by the id number of the {{person}}, by email address or by date fields if you have set any up. As the system finds matches, you will see a drop-down list:

![Search as you type drop- down]({{imgpath}}42a.png)

Click on their name to view their profile. If you continue typing the system will keep searching, so if you don't see the {{person}} you're searching for initially, keep typing. 

Each {{person}} has a unique profile id number. This is displayed clearly on their profile if you keep profiles anonymous. If you save a {{person}} under their name, their id number can be found within their profile by hovering the mouse over the text **Profile for ...**. When searching for a {{person}} by their ID number, you will need to make sure it is 3 digits long by adding zeros to the start of the number (e.g. to find person 23, type 023 into the search box). Dates should be entered in the format dd/mm/yyyy, using the '/' character to separate each part. Email addresses need to be entered in full before the search can begin.

You can also search the entire system by clicking the 'find' button - see section [4.2.0  Menu Search Bar](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.2.0) .
