Adding Message Content
If you are creating mailing labels, you’ll see a mail-merge address block is already present in the text box. You can edit this if you choose, but don’t need to do anything else.
For letters and emails you can click on the + in the top right of the text box, which will reveal the rich text editing tools.

If you have chosen to send a separate letter or email to each {{person}}, you can use the ‘{{People}} Mail Merge’ drop-down menu. It contains a number of fields which you can add so that your message autofills information. Choose them from the drop-down {{group}} and use them in your text as you would actual content. For example, I can write ‘Dear (space), select ‘first name’ from the drop-down {{group}} before moving to the next line. When merged, ‘First name’ will be replaced by the name of each {{person}} you send your email to.
You can copy and paste into the text box. We recommend pasting as plain text, or pasting the text into Notebook first, and then copying from there, to make sure that any existing html formatting is removed. The text editor will try to filter extra code, which can have unexpected results.
There are also some buttons in the rich text editor which will help you to check your text for html issues:

Testing and Sending
There are three options once you&#039;ve completed your {{comm}}:
The &#039;test&#039; button will produce a test version of the document, or for emails will send a copy to your own email address. Do not navigate away from the &#039;Message content&#039; tab in Lamplight while you look at it so that you can make any amendments before sending.
The ‘Save but do not send’ button only {{work}}s if you have the {{Comm}}s Module, so that you can create drafts and return to them later.
Click &#039;Create/Send&#039; to create the document or send the email.
If you have created letters or mailing labels, they will either open directly in Word for you to print out, or appear in a download box at the bottom of your screen. Click on this to open it.
If you have created email, this will send directly from your account. (Please note, you will need to have added your email settings in the system admin section for this to {{work}}. For more information on this, please see [16.11.0 Setting Up Email](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/16.11.0)).
Please note, if you do not have the {{Comm}}s Module your {{comm}} will not be saved in the system. For more on the module, please see [21.0.0 The {{Comm}}s Module](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/21.0.0).
