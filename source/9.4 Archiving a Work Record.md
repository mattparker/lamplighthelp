Note: this was previously called ‘delete’ (the functionality is the same)
1. Find the record you want to delete. There are three places you can go, and they will all take you to the same delete option:
From the diary: Find the record in the diary and left click on it for the context menu (see 3.3 for diary navigation)
From the profile: open the profile of the relevant {{person}}, go to the ‘{{Work}} records’ tab and find the record in the table (see 9.1on viewing records in the profile). Either click the Context menu button (three horizontal lines) in the left hand column of the table, or right click the record you need to edit.
From the {{Activity}} tab: find the record in the table (see 9.1on viewing records in the profile). Either click the Context menu button (three horizontal lines) in the left hand column of the table, or right click the record you need to edit.
