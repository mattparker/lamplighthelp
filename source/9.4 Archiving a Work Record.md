# 9.4 Archiving a Work Record

**It is possible for operators who have Manager or Administrator levels of access to archive {{activity}} records. This should be done with caution, as there is no way to unarchive them**

Note: this was previously called ‘delete’ (the functionality is the same)

1. Find the record you want to delete. There are three places you can go, and they will all take you to the same delete option:
- From the diary: Find the record in the diary and left click on it for the context menu (see [3.3 Diary Navigation](/help/index/p/3.3))
- From the profile: open the profile of the relevant {{person}}, go to the ‘{{Work}} records’ tab and find the record in the table (see 9.1on viewing records in the profile). Either click the Context menu button (three horizontal lines) in the left hand column of the table, or right click the record you need to edit.
- From the {{Activity}} tab: find the record in the table (see 9.1on viewing records in the profile). Either click the Context menu button (three horizontal lines) in the left hand column of the table, or right click the record you need to edit.

- If it is a recurring record, you will be given the option to delete all the records in the series. This would erase every record that was still part on the recurring sequence. For more on this, see [7.2 Recurring Work Records](/help/index/p/7.2).
