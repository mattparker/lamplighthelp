# 37 Reporting from Templates

If you run the same {{report}} on a regular basis, your system administrators can set up a template for it. You will then be able to choose it from a {{group}} and run the {{report}} automatically.

[Learn how to create report templates here.](/help/index/p/16.9)

1. To see the templates set up in your system, click on {{Report}}s on the main menu bar

2. You will see any templates set up under each different type of {{activity}} {{report}}. They show after the first link &#039;New xxx {{report}} using your own criteria&#039;

4. You can use a {{report}} template as a spring board for different but similar date, simply by changing the {{report}} filters and presentation once you've run the report. Doing this doesn't change the template in any way, it just changes the data you are looking at in that moment.
