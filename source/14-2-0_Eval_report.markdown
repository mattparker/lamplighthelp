# 14.2.0    {{Eval}} {{Report}}

> The {{eval}} {{report}} presents summaries of completed {{eval}} questionnaires. The {{report}} shows each question, with the number (or percentage) of responses for each option 

### {{Report}} Filters

- From the main menu select {{report}}s -> {{eval}}s {{report}}. 
- Enter the filter information as required. This is the same as for other {{report}} types (see [13.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1) for more information).
- At the bottom of the filters page there are two more options: 'Select '{{eval}}' and 'Select campaign' (you will only see the second of these if you have the {{Eval}}s Direct Module). 
  - 'Select eval' lets you choose a specific type of {{eval}} to report on. This means that, if you have an exit questionnaire, for example, you can report on all the responses across the year. If you do not select one of these options then {{Lamplight}} will give results for all your {{eval}}s.n the '{{Report}} filters' tab there is an additional option, 'Select {{eval}}', listing the {{eval}}s available. You have to choose one of these - the top option is always selected by default.
  - 'Select campaign'. If you have the Datadirect Module you will also see this option. Each time you set up a new {{eval}} to send out, this is called a 'campaign'. You can choose the one that you want to report on from the drop-down. If you do this, {{Lamplight}} will igore the {{eval}} chosen in the 'Select {{eval}}' box above.

### The {{Report}} Results

- The {{report}} will produce a series of tables, one for each question in the {{eval}}.

### {{Report}} Presentation

In the '{{Report}} presentation' tab you can:
- Choose column data. If {{eval}}s have been linked to a particular {{person}} when they were entered, it is possible to split data using their demographic information.  Use the drop-down box to choose a custom field the you would like to see as the column in your results table. In the example below we choose to show columns by gender:

  When we run the table again, the columns show the 'gender' field information:

- You can also, in the 'Show data as' field, choose whether you would like your results to be shown as a count of the number of responses for each question, or as percentages. The table below shows the percentages option. If you are looking at the percentages,

### {{Eval}} Filters

- Once you have run the initial {{report}} an extra tab will be added: '{{Eval}} filters'. This enables you to filter the {{report}} by responses to one or more questions. For example, in our {{report}} we want to filter it to show what eveyone who accessed the 'High trees' service responded to the rest of the survey.

- Select the filters you wish to use and run the {{report}} again for a smaller set of {{eval}} responses. 

The results in the tables will now be shown just for those people who gave the answers that you chose.. 

### Downloading Your Results

- Under the results tables you get three options to download your data:

![{{Eval}} {{Report}} Download Options](14.2.0c.png)

  - Download as document. This will open as a Word (or open source) document with a table for each response.
  - Download as tables in one spreadsheet. This opens a spreadsheet with the responses to one question per worksheet.
  - Download complete responses. This exports all the data into a spreadsheet. If the separate surveys went out to individuals (rather than one survey to all) names will be included on the sheet, so you will need to take care that it is suitably encrypted to protect personal data.
