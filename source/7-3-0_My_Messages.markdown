# 7.3.0    My {{Message}}s

> Your {{message}}s - messages, reminders, to-do's - are like your post-it notes - but with dates attached and linked to other information in {{Lamplight}}. 

Set yourself reminders or {{message}}s that will show not only in the table found under the My {{Message}}s tab, but will also be highlighted on the diary so that no appointment or action needs to be missed. 

Within the My {{Message}}s tab, add a new row to create a new {{message}} and work along the row, clicking inside each box to enter in information.

The {{message}} created will be shown in the diary with a distinctive red line on the left hand side.

Tasks can also be linked to and created from {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{grant}} and {{eval}} records. They appear in a separate tab on the {{work}} etc. record.

Please note for these to appear within records, your system administrator will need to customise the global settings accordingly.
