# 27.3.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Add, Edit and Delete {{Staff}} Activity Information

> With the {{Staff}} Management Module you can add training, absence, appraisal and non-contact records to {{staff}} profiles

Training, absence, appraisal and non-contact records can be added to staff profiles in the same way. It is like adding a {{work}} record. 

**Creating a new record**

- Go to the {{staff}} member's profile and click on the tab you wish to enter information into. 
- On the right hand side of the screen click 'add'. 
- A new form wil open.
- The record is split into tabs; when and where, attendance and details. These must be completed before choosing to save. 

The process required here follows a similar process that is used when adding {{work}} records (see section [9.1.0  Adding a {{work}} record](/help/index/p/9.1.0)). The record is split into tabs; when and where, attendance and details. These must be completed before choosing to save. 

**Editing and deleting records**

- Existing records will appear in a table in the relevant tab.
- Right click over the row of information, or left click on the menu button to the left of it.
- From this menu, you can choose to 'View full details', 'Edit' or 'Delete'.
