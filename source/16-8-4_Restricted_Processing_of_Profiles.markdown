# 16.8.4  <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Restricted Processing of Profiles

> If a {{person}} requests that processing of their data is restricted, go to their profile and click the 'Restrict processing' button



'Restricted processing' is a particular right for data subjects under the GDPR (art 10(1)(a)-(d)). If a data subject requests that processing is restricted then their data can still be stored but can't be processed unless it is with their consent or relates to legal claims, the rights of others or reasons of important public interest.  Further information about this is available on the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-restrict-processing/).

Important things to note about restricted profiles:

- They can be restricted and then unrestricted again.
- Only Manager or Admin level operators can do this.
- Restricted profiles are not included when doing any kind of reporting, or in searches.
- Restricted profile names will show in the duplicate checker.
- If you view a restricted profile it will say 'Restricted for Processing' very clearly across the top of the page. 

### To Restrict Processing

- Open the relevant profile.
- Click the ‘Restrict processing’ button on the top right of the page.
- Click 'yes' to confirm that you wish to restrict processing. 

You will be taken back to the home page.

### Viewing Restricted Profiles
System Administrators can view restricted profiles. 

- Go to '{{people}} -> view -> (choose the type of {{person}} this is, e.g. {{user}}.
- In the search bar above the table set ‘Limit list to’ ‘People restricted for processing’.

- Click the ‘fetch data’ button. 
- This will give you a table showing all {{user}}s (if this is the profile type you chose) who are currently restricted for processing.
- From here you can click on the name in the table to view the profile. 
- When the profile opens you'll see a warning message at the top:

### Unrestricting a Profile
If the restriction needs to be lifted and the data subject has been notified that it will be, you can unrestrict the profile. Only System Admins can do this. 

Follow the steps above to find the profile you want to unrestrict in the table. You can either unrestrict it in the table:
   - Find the {{person}} in the table and click on the menu button to the left of their name. You can also right click in the table row. 
   - From the menu, choose 'Unrestrict'.
   
Or you can open the profile by clicking on their name:
   - Click on the 'Allow processing' button to the top right of their profile page. 
   - Choose 'yes' in the next pop-up box.
