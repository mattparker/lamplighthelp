# 4.3.5    Downloading tables

> Tables can be downloaded into spreadsheet packages with a single click 

To download a table into spreadsheet packages (those compatible with OpenOffice or Excel 2007), click the 'Download data' link at the foot of the table. A download will be produced with the information from the table on screen.

A new tab or window will open in your browser and you will be prompted to open or save the file (this can vary based on your browser and browser settings). The download will be created with the data as it is shown currently in the table.

At the foot of each table, there is also the option to 'Print table'. Once selected a new print-friendly version of the table will open in a new tab on your browser.
