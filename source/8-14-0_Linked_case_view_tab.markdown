# 8.14.0    {{Linked case}} view tab

> The {{Linked case}} view tab shows details of all the {{linked case}}s a particular {{person}} has been involved in. 

The tab displays a list of all records linked (and not-linked) to a {{linked case}}. To help the page stay 'clutter-free' all details aren't shown from the initial view. The {{linked case}} name (given when a {{linked case}} is initially created, see section [13.2.0  Opening a new {{linked case}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.2.0) ), the {{linked case}} ID (automatically assigned by {{Lamplight}}) and summary detail is displayed on a series of buttons down the left-hand side. If you wish to look at a {{linked case}} in greater details, click on the button:

![{{linked case}} view]({{imgpath}}217a.png)

All records linked to the {{linked case}} will be shown. If you wish to re-organise the table or view further details, please see section [4.3.0  Tables](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.3.0) which provides details of how this can be done.
