# 29.1 Creating A Manual {{Group}}

Manual {{group}}s can be used when there is a set of people who have nothing particular to link them in {{Lamplight}}. They may be members of a committee, for example.

4. Name your {{group}} and write a {{group}} description as they are both a requirement
- Add a name and description of the {{group}} which will help you and other users of the system remember what it is for. The {{group}} will be available for other operators who have access to your system.
- If it is important that you are the only person and System Administrators who can add and remove people from the {{group}}, tick the 'lock this {{group}} for editing' box. That way you can be sure it hasn't changed without you knowing.

6. In the search box, start typing the name of the {{person}}, {{org}} or {{family}} you wish to include in your {{group}}. A drop-down box will appear showing all matches. 
- If the name you want to add is not on the list, keep typing until it appears. 
- Once you see it in the list, click on it to add them to the table.
- To remove someone from the list, click the red cross in the right-hand column of the table: you will be asked if you are sure. If you are, click 'OK' and they will be removed from the table and the {{group}}.
