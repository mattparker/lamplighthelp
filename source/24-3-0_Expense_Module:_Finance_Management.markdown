### Authorising and Paying Expenses

- Go to 'admin -> finances -> expenses'.
- You will see a table of expenses incurred. 
   - Click on the search bar above this table to find filters (such as date and status) that you can apply to narrow down the records that you are seeing. 
   - When you have chosen your filter options, click the 'fetch data' button and the table below will be refreshed.
- The system will not allow the same person to claim, authorise, and pay expenses. Different database operators will need to be involved in the process. 
- You can see which of the expenses you can authorise or pay in the last two columns of the table: 'Are you able to authorise?' and 'Are you able to pay?'.   
   - You may not authorise expenses that you have incurred yourself.
   - If you have the Staff Management Module, you can only authorise payments for people that you do not manage. 
   - If you do not have the Staff Management Module, database operators with a Manager or System/Project Administrator level of access can authorise claims.
