# 5.1 Adding a Profile

To add a new profile for a {{person}} or {{org}}:

1. To create a new profile, click the profile tab on the main menu

2. Click on &#039;add&#039;

3. Choose the type of profile - either &#039;{{person}}&#039; {{org}}’ or ‘{{family}}’ (these options may differ in your system – and ‘role’ (again, these will probably not match those shown here)

4. Fill in the information as necessary (you don’t need to complete all the fields) and click &#039;save&#039; at the bottom

- All profiles, whether they are for {{user}}s, {{staff}}, {{funder}}s, {{org}}s or {{contact}}s start from the same initial input page. However, they must be either a {{person}} or an {{org}} (you may also have '{{family}}' as an option): select which using the 'Type' options.

- If you are entering a {{person}} you will see input boxes for title, first name, surname and suffix. (Titles and suffixes will be available if your System Administrator has added them in the 'system administration' section). If you are entering an {{org}} you will see an input box for the {{org}} name.

- There may be some more information that you have to provide. This depends on whether your organisation has chosen to make it a requirement to include certain information in a profile (for example, an individual's permission to store their data.)

- If you have multiple projects in your system, you may also be asked to choose a project-sharing policy. Ask your Project Administrator about this if you’re uncertain. If you need to continue at this point, click ‘no sharing’, which can be updated later.

5. You will now see the profile page for the {{person}} you have just entered

Along from their name is a series of buttons; 'Print', 'Restrict Processing', 'Archive' and 'Edit name'.

- Print: will open a new tab in your web browser with their profile information for you to choose which tabs of information you wish to print.
- Restricted processing: When a {{person}} requests that you restrict the processing of their data (under the [GDPR](/help/index/p/tagged_GDPR), you can add restricted processing to a profile so that you can't edit it, and it will not be included in any reporting.
- Archive: will remove the profile from the active system and archive it so that it will not appear in day to day use. It can still be retrieved if needed and can also be included in reports.
- Edit name: will open a form so that you can edit the name and type of profile.
