# 23.1.0 {{Eval}}s Direct Module: Set-up

> If you already have some {{eval}} templates set up in the {{Eval}}s Module, then {{Eval}}s Direct takes minimal set-up before you can begin using it

Please see [22.1.0 Setting Up {{Eval}}s](/help/index/p/22.1.0) for more information on creating {{eval}} templates. The {{Eval}}s Direct Module allows the creation of campaigns based on these {{eval}}s.

There are only a few things in system administration for {{Eval}}s Direct that you need to be aware of.

### Managing Colour Schemes

System Administrators can define colour schemes for all database operators to use in {{eval}} campaigns.
- Go to 'admin -> system administration’ then scroll down to the 'Module Administration' section. 
- Find the '{{Eval}}s Module' section, and click on 'Manage colour schemes for DataDirect campaigns'.

   - **Creating and Editing Colour Schemes**  
   
   - Either click ‘add a new one’ to create a new colour scheme, or click the name of an existing one to edit it.

   - To choose a colour, click the box alongside one of the elements. Either use the colour-picker (first choosing the hue using the slider on the right, then the brightness and saturation by clicking in the square area, then click ‘save change’), or enter the hex code for a specific colour (many websites allow hex codes to be identified from images or RGB codes).

   - When the required colours have been specified, click the ‘save’ button.
   - If any fields are left blank, they will default to black in the case of text, lines and borders, and white in the case of backgrounds.
   

   - **Applying Colour Schemes**  

- When creating a new {{Eval}}s Campaign there is a 'Text and styling’ option towards the bottom of the third tab. Available colour-schemes are listed.

### Custom CSS

Custom CSS can be used to change the appearance of an evaluation campaign. CSS is a markup language that controls the appearance of HTML elements on a web page. It is only advisable to do this if competent using CSS, and Lamplight cannot offer any support with it. Custom CSS can be added at the bottom of the ‘Edit form’ page.
