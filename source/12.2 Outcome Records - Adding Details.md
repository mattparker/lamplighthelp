# 12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details

**The ''When and where' tab in an {{outcome}} record is where you can enter details of when the {{outcome}} was measured and what {{workarea}} it relates to**

The date and {{workarea}} fields on the when and where tab are required. Many organisations will be able to simply ignore the time for the purposes of outcome records.

You must select one {{workarea}}, and you can choose any number of {{subworkarea}}s.

### When and where tab
1. Edit the time and date either by adding them manually or using the ‘calendar’ button to the right of the entry box

2. Select one {{work}}area and any number of sub-{{work}}areas (you will have your own {{work}}areas in your system)
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 2](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_2.png)

3.  Select one or more locations (this is optional)
You can select as many locations as necessary or none. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect.

### Respondent tab
The 'Attendance' or 'Respondent' tab is where you enter details of the {{person}} or {{org}} involved in the {{outcome}}(s)

The 'Attendance' tab (on some systems this will be called 'Respondent') records details of everyone for whom this {{outcome}} applies. This is most likely to be a single {{person}}. However, there may be times when you need to enter these in bulk, for example if a group of {{people}} have achieved a training qualification that you wish to record.

{{Outcome}}s do not need to only be for your {{user}}s - you can add them for anyone who has a profile on the system.

1. Click on either the ‘Respondent’ tab at the top, or ‘next’ at the bottom to go to the next page
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 4](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_4.png)

2. Start typing the name of the profile the {{outcome}} relates to in the ‘{{Outcome}} about {{user}}’ box. A drop-down menu will appear showing all matches
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 5](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_5.png)

3. Click on the name you are looking for to add it to the record
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 6](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_6.png)

4. If you want to add a {{staff}} member to the record, start typing their name in the ‘{{Outcome}} recorded with/by {{staff}}’ box. When their name appears, click on it to add it to the record
If {{Lamplight}} does not find the person, please check that they have a profile in the system. It may be possible to add the person to your system at this point. For more on this see [12.2.1 Outcome Records: Adding New Profiles Via the Attendance Table](/help/index/p/12.2.1).

You can also add members of a {{group}} in bulk: 

- Start typing the name of the {{group}} in the search box and you will see matching {{group}}s too. 
- If you click on a {{group}} the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.

![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 7](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_7.png)

Once you have your participants in the table, you can alter their role or attendance type by clicking on the relevant table cell and selecting from the drop-down box. Your system administrator can add options to these lists.

To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. 

### Simple Attendance Table
Some systems will use the simple attendance table, which is differentiated by the tab being called 'Respondent'.  This follows the same principle, but only gives you the option to add one {{user}} and one member of {{staff}} or {{volunteer}}. 

### Recording the {{Outcome}} Values

Each different set of {{outcome}} measures that you have in your system will have its own tab in the {{outcome}} record. In our example system, these are the {{outcome}}s we are measuring (outlined in the red box):

1. Click on the tab at the top of the record which relates to the {{outcome}} you are recording (there are 2 in this example, ‘Impact’ and ‘Confidence’, but your system will reflect your {{org}}’s {{outcome}} measures)
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 8](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_8.png)

2. Work down the page recording your {{outcome}} results

a. If it is a score, you can enter the number manually or by using the up and down arrows to the right of the input box
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 9](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_9.png)

b. If it is a star rating, click on the star you want
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 10](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_10.png)

c. If it is an {{outcome}} with emojis, pick the one you need
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 11](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_11.png)

d. For {{outcome}}s with descriptive options, pick the one you need from the drop-down menu
![12.2 {{Outcome}} Records - Adding Details - step 12](12.2_Outcome_Records_-_Adding_Details_im_12.png)

Once you have entered the actual score or yes/no, you can also add a comment to the score. The comment can be any text, perhaps an explanation or evidence. It is not a field that can be reported on, but it can be seen when viewing the saved record, as a column in the  table view on the {{Outcome}}s tab (for more on this see [25.4 Viewing All {{Outcome}} Records in a Table](/help/index/p/25.4) or as a column in the {{outcome}}s table (see [13 {{Outcomes}} - Viewing An individual's Records](/help/index/p/13)

The 'our work' tick box means that you can record changes in the {{person}}'s situation, even if they are not the result of your work. This is for reference only and can be seen if you view the completed {{outcome}}s record.

You can enter information for as few or as many {{outcome}}s as you wish. When you have finished, click the 'save' button at the bottom-right of the page.

3. When you’ve finished, click on ‘Save’ at the bottom of the page
