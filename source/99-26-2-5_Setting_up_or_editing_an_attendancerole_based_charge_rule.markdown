Section [26.2.1  Setting up charge rules - general points](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.2.1) explains the 'name' and 'previous rules' fields. 

The table shows attendance types down the left, and roles along the top. Each cell represents the combination (e.g. 'service user that attended'). For each of these you can specify an amount or a percentage. If you set an amount (e.g. Â£50) then they will be charged that amount: this is not culmulative from previous rules. If you set a percentage (e.g. 75%), this will use an amount from a previous rule. If you use percentages, you probably don't want to use the rule first in the policy. You could do, but it will come out as 0 (as n% of 0 is 0). 

You can mix and match fixed amounts and percentages for in attendance cells of the table. 

When you are finished, click 'save' in the bottom- right hand corner. You will be taken back to the charging menu, and you'll see your new rule in the 'charge rules' section.
