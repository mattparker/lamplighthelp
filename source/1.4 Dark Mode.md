# 1.4 Dark Mode

1. Lamplight can run in dark mode in your browser, displaying a black background, with lighter coloured text. Dark mode will appear slightly differently depending on your colour selections, but the standard colour choices display as a dark background on white text.

2. This shows you a profile in Dark mode. The content is identical, it&#039;s just the colours which are different.

3. Dark mode is enabled at browser level, and is either on, or off for your browser. Although each browser has a different way of enabling this, there are commonalities. In Edge, Chrome and Firefox click on the Menu in the top right of the browser (either three dots, or three lines), and choose ‘Settings’

In the settings page, look for the search box, and type in ‘Dark’

The ‘System default’ or ‘Automatic’ mode will follow the chosen mode for your whole computer. So if Windows is a dark mode, the browser automatically will be the same.
