# 13.1.6 Running a {{Report}} from a Template

> If you run the same {{report}} on a regular basis, your system administrators can set up a template for it.  You will then be able to choose it from a list and run the {{report}} automatically

If there are {{report}}s that you need to run regularly, your System Administrator can set up a template (for more on how to do this, see [16.9.0 Creating ((Report)) Templates](/help/index/p/16.9.0)). 

- Click on the type of {{report}} you need to run (for example '{{work}}'.
- You will see a list of the templates available in addition to the 'custom' {{report}} option.

- Click on the one that you want. This will open up the {{report}} filters page, where you will need to scroll to the bottom to see the {{report}}.

- If you need to change any of the saved filters, you can do this as you would when creating a new {{report}}. This will not change the filters for the template itself.
