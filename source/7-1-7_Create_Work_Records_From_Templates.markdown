# 7.1.7  <i class="fas fa-hammer"></i>  Creating {{Work}} Records using Create {{Activity}} Templates

> Create {{Activity}} Templates are partially completed {{work}} records that you can use to pre-fill fields in a {{work}} record

If you have standard types of {{work}} record your System Administrator may have set up some 'Create {{Activity}} Templates'
which are partially completed records. When you use a Template you'll find some of the fields already completed, so that
you just have to fill in what's changed.

If you have any in your system, you'll see them on the main menu and in drop downs wherever you have an 'add {{work}}' 
button:

![Creating template {{message}}s](7.1.7a.png)

To use a template, click on it and the 'add new {{work}}' screen will open as normal, but with more fields completed, 
depending on what your system administrator has set up for you. Templates may include pre-set {{message}}s with dates 
calculated from the date of the record. Note that if you change the date of the {{work}} record, you may need to update
the {{message}} dates too.

You can create a record from scratch by just clicking "add {{work}}" as normal.  

If you don't see any templates, instructions for system administrators to set them up are on [page 16.10.1](/help/index/p/16.10.1)
of the manual.
