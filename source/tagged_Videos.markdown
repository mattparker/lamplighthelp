# Videos
We have created videos to help you learn new skills in {{Lamplight}}, whether you're a new user, or looking to pick up a few tips.

### [Basic Training](help/index/p/51.0.0)

Basic Training is a collection of videos aimed at new staff, to give them an understanding of how information is recorded in {{Lamplight}}. To get the most out of these videos we recommend that you view them in order–later videos build on the information contained in earlier ones. However, they can also be viewed individually by people who need a refresher in a particular aspect of the system.
