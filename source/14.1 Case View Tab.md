# 14.1 {{Linked case}} View Tab

The '{{Linked case}} view' tab shows details of all the {{linked case}}s associated with a particular {{person}} or {{org}}

IF you use {{linked case}}s in your system, you will probably have a tab called {{Linked case}} view in profiles. If you do not have this it will either be because it is not selected in your operator template or because your System Administrator has chosen not to use this tab. They can switch it on in global settings.

The tab displays a list of all records in {{linked case}}s, as well as those which have not been linked to any {{linked case}}. Each {{linked case}} shows in its own box.

1. Open the profile. You will see the {{linked case}} view tab

2. The tab displays all the {{linked case}}s linked to this profile, and records which have not been linked to any {{linked case}}.
Each {{linked case}} shows in its own box.
When you open the tab, the unlinked records will be shown, with all the {{linked case}}s down the left-hand side.
