# 16.6.1 System Administration - {{Workarea}}s

> In system administration, you can see a list of current {{workareas}} in the '{{work}} and {{outcomes}}' section. The {{workarea}} itself is listed in bold with the {{subworkarea}}s listed below it. You can add to and edit these.

{{Workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s are managed in a similar to other lists within the system administration menu (see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/18.2.0) ).

**Adding a new {{workarea}}**

- Always create and type in your {{workarea}} heading initially, so that it appears in bold, before adding the {{subworkarea}}s below it. 
- We would recommend that colours are added AFTER the headings have been entered. 
- To colour co-ordinate your {{workarea}}s, double-click over **Background colour** and select the colour by moving the cursor around the colour pad. 
- Click **save changes** to save. 

**Editing {{workarea}}s**

Before editing or deleting {{workareas}} you need to be aware that:

- you should only change the name of the {{workarea}} if the meaning is staying the same, for example due to a spelling error or a re-brand. If you changed 'football session' to 'rugby', for example, the recorded data for that {{workarea}} would remain the same, so all the previous football session records would now read, and be reported on, as rugby.

**Deleting {{workareas}}**

- Deleting {{workareas}} from the list in system admin means that they will no longer appear in the list when adding {{work}} and other records, and no records can be linked to them in the future. 
- You are **only** removing the list item, you're not deleting historical work records. 
- While you will still be able to see the records which were previously tagged with your deleted {{workarea}}, you will not be able to sort by this for {{group}}s or {{report}}s.
