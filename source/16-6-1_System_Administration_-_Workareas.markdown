# 16.6.1 System Administration - {{Workarea}}s

> In system administration, you can see a list of current {{workareas}} in the '{{work}} and {{outcomes}}' section. The {{workarea}} itself is listed in bold with the {{subworkarea}}s listed below it. You can add to and edit these.

{{Workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s are managed in a similar to other lists within the system administration menu (see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/18.2.0) ).:

**When adding a new {{workarea}}**

- Always create and type in your {{workarea}} heading initially, so that it appears in bold, before adding the {{subworkarea}}s below it. 
- We would recommend that colours are added AFTER the headings have been entered. 
- To colour co-ordinate your {{workarea}}s, double-click over **Background colour** and select the colour by moving the cursor around the colour pad. 
- Click **save changes** to save.
