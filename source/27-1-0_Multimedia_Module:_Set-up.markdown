# 27.1.0 Multimedia Module: Set-up in System Administration

> Before you use the Multimedia Module you will need to set up file categories in system administration. These allow you to sort and filter you media files in a profile

When file is uploaded to a profile, it can be assigned a category to help see at a glance what it is. An example of categories that you might want to use could be things to do with your process - application forms, {{referral}} forms, {{outcome}}s evidence and profile pictures, for instance. 

### Creating a file Category

System Administrator level access is required to configure the file categories. 

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage media setting’ section, click ‘Manage file categories’.

- Double-click where it says ‘double-click to add’ to reveal a text field (this option will always appear at the bottom of the list).
- Type the name of the category in this box, then press 'enter' on your keyboard to save. 
- A new 'double click to add' field will appear at the bottom of the list. Continue creating categories as required.

### Editing and Deleting a File Category

- You can edit the name of an existing category by double clicking over the text to open it up as a text box. 
- Once you’ve finished editing, click ‘enter’ on your keyboard to save your changes.
- To delete a list item, drag it to the grey rectangle labelled ‘Drag here to delete’ at the bottom of the list of file categories.

- It is not possible to delete a new file category immediately after setting it up. You will need to leave the file categories page, then re-open it first.
