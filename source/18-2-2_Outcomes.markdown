# 18.2.2    {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s are split up into main categories, with the actual indicators/measures within the category. 

You can have as many {{outcome}} categories as required, and each may hold as many {{outcome}} indicators within them, although for practical reasons we'd suggest no more than ten indicators in each category. The {{outcome}} category is displayed in bold with the {{outcome}} indicators numbered below.

Adding {{outcome}}s uses the same method as in section [18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.1). Double click to add text and press the 'enter' key to save. 

You can score {{outcome}}s in different ways; a scale system, yes/no and numerical. Double click over the option and a drop-down list will appear, click on your selection. Alternatively as the box is open, type the first letter of the option: S, Y or N (Score, Yes/no or Numerical).

To edit and delete, follow the guidelines as detailed in section [18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.1), making sure you delete each {{outcome}} indicator in turn, before deleting the {{outcome}} category box.
