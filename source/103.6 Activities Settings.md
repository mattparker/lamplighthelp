# 103.6 Activities Settings

The sixth and final tab is Activities. This contains settings for how {{activity}} records are handled

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 1](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_1.png)

1. The top section controls the date range of records which are loaded by default in {{activity}} tables, such as in the {{work}} records tab

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 2](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_2.png)

You can change the date filters when viewing tables. This setting only determines the default view.

2. Set the ‘how to calculate the ‘Date from’ box to show how far back records should go, and the ‘How to calculate the ‘Date to’ box to show how far into the future records are shown by default

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 3](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_3.png)

In this {{linked case}}, records would load for 10 years in the past up to today.
Negative numbers, such as -4 months, will show records before today’s date. Positive numbers show records after today’s date. We recommend you choose as narrow a date range as will suit you to avoid waiting for unnecessary records to load every time you look at a table.

3. Other options in Activities tab:

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 4](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_4.png)

  3.a. ‘Use tabs on forms’ checkbox
Using tabs on forms is standard in Lamplight. For example, a {{work}} record is broken into three or more tabs. Unticking this shows all the data on one long page. This is a rare option to use.

  3.b. ‘Always add operator to the attendance table on {{work}} records’
&#039;Always add operator to the attendance table&#039; means {{staff}} automatically attend records they create, and don&#039;t need to add themselves. If you have an administrator adding records for {{staff}}, this should be unchecked so that they don’t get added in error.

  3.c. ‘Use autosave on {{activity}} records’
Check this option to save records as soon as a {{Work}} area and any other required fields are completed. It will continue to autosave every 2 minutes.

  3.d. &#039;Show {{staff}} initials attending {{work}} and other records?’
Tick this box to create a column showing the initials of all {{staff}} attending records when they are viewed in a table. Choose the option from the dropdown menu of how you would like the initials to be formatted.

  3.e. &#039;Show appointment information fields in {{referral}}s’
Check this box to add an &#039;Appointment time and date&#039; section to all {{referral}} records. If you don&#039;t normally see/use this in your {{referral}} records, untick this box.

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 5](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_5.png)

4. Choose Dataviews to add information to attendance tables when you view a single {{activity}} record from the ‘Data views to use when viewing {{activity}} records’ section

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 6](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_6.png)

When you’re viewing a single {{activity}} record ({{work}}, {{outcome}} or {{referral}}, for example) you will see the attendance table. Use these dropdown menus to specify which {{group}} dataview Lamplight uses to add information to attendance table columns, for example addresses and contact details.
This is a {{work}} attendance table with a contact details dataview added:

![103.6 Activities Settings - step 7](103.6_Activities_Settings_im_7.png)

You can choose a different dataview for the attendance table of each type of {{activity}} record.

5. Ensure you save your changes after completing all the tabs. Click &#039;Save&#039; at the bottom of the page.
