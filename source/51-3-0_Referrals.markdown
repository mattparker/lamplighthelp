# 51.3.0 {{Referral}}s

> {{Referral}} records provide a place to document where {{user}}s come to you from, as well as where you have signposted them on to 

They can hold details of who is involved in the situation (the people who are doing the referring, the {{user}} who is being referred and the place or person theyâ€™re being referred to) as well as other notes that you need to keep for future reference.
