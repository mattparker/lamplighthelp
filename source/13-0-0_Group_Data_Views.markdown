# 13.0.0 {{Group}} Data Views

> {{Group}} data views are a template of information you would like to view about {{group}} members. You can use both profile and {{activity}} record information in a data view



{{Group}} data views are a way of selecting specific pieces of information you want to view about {{people}}. 

For example, once you have created a {{group}} you may want to be able to view the date each member last attended a session, and their contact details. You can create a {{group}} data view to pull that information from the records in {{Lamplight}} and then show it in table columns next to the names in your {{group}}.

{{Group}} data views do not filter the {{people}} in your {{group}}s: they simply add details to these {{group}}s.

It is best not to create {{group}} data views with too much in them.If you are asking for a lot of information it will need a large table with multiple columns which would be difficult to view.  It takes longer for {{Lamplight}} to process and show the data. It is  better to create a number of smaller {{group}} data views for different purposes.

To use the {{group}} data views you have created, see section [12.2.0 Using {{Group}} Data Views in {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/p/12.2.0).
