# 6.3.0 Viewing All {{Referral}} Records

> You can view all the {{referral}} records on your system in one place, as well as filtering them to show by different dates and {{workarea}}s, for example

To view all {{referral}} records, click '{{work}} -> view -> {{referral}}' on the main menu.

The {{referral}}s table shows a variety of information stored in the records, including the referrer, and who the {{referral}} was made to.

![Viewing {{Referral}}s](196a.png)

It lists all {{referral}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date, with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown when you view this table can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each database operator. If you can't see the records that you expected to be there, you can change the dates of the records you are viewing in the search bar (see below). 

### Choosing the Standard Columns to Display in the Table

If you want to see all the available columns that you can display in the {{referral}}s table, right click on the top coloured header row. You will see a box showing all the possible columns. Tick and untick (you will have to do this one column at a time) to choose which you would like to display.

### Saving your View

Once you have finished selecting the columns you want to see, you can save the columns you have at as the default view, so that the next time you look at this table it will be the same. To do that:
- Right click again on the top coloured header row of the table.
- From the bottom of the pop-up list, choose 'Save table columns layout'.  

This will only apply to you, and not the rest of your team. If you would like to change back to the system standard view, choose 'Reset table columns layout'.

### The Search Bar

The search bar above the table gives options to filter which data you are seeing, and to add in some additional columns. 

**Restrict by Date and Work Area**

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s:
- Click the search bar or the '+' icon on the right of the search bar.
- Search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button.
- The table will update showing the requested information.

**Restrict by Custom Fields**

Once you have clicked the search bar as above, and the date and work area options are displayed, you will see a further two search bars shown below this.  The first called 'Custom field filters'.  This lets you select additional filtering options, from the fields inside your  {{referral}} record.  Click the 'Fetch data' button to show records matching these filters.

**Display Additional Columns**

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Options here will allow you to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your work records.

### The {{Referral}} Table Context Menus

To the left of each record in the table you will see a menu button. If you do not have these, you can add them in your personal settings (for more on this see [16.4.1 Personal Settings - Logging in and General Settings](/help/index/p/16.4.1)). Alternatively,right click the row that you want in the table. This will bring up a menu with the option to view, edit and (if you are a Manager or System Administrator in {{Lamplight}}) delete the records.

If you are using {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see options for those on the menu. If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you will have the option to 'Communicate', which will open up a new {{comm}}s record.

### Downloading and Printing the Table

If you want to download the information you have searched for into a spreadsheet:
- Make sure that all the rows of the table are showing on the page (you can do this by choosing to show 'all' in the dropdown box above the table, then click the 'Download' button at the below of the table.  
- Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose. Each of these will open in a new tab.
