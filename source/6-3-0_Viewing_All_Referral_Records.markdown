# 6.3.0    Viewing All {{Referral}} Records

> You can view all the {{referral}} records on your system in one place, as well as filtering them to show by different dates and {{workarea}}s, for example

To view all {{referral}} records, click '{{work}} -> view -> {{referral}}' on the main menu.

The {{referral}}s table shows a variety of information stored in the records, including the referrer, and who the {{referral}} was made to.

It lists all {{referral}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date, with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown when you view this table can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each database operator.  

**Choosing the standard columns to display in the table**

If you want to see all the available columns for display in a {{referral}}s table, right click on the top coloured header bar of the table. You will see a box showing all the possible columns. Tick and untick (you will have to do this one column at a time) to choose which you would like to display.

**Saving your view**

Once you have finished selecting the columns you would like to see, you can save that as the default view for the next time you open the table. To do that:
- Right click again on the top coloured header row of the table.
- From the bottom of the pop-up list, choose 'Save table columns layout'.  

This will only apply to you, and not the rest of your team. If you would like to change back to the system standard view, choose 'Reset table columns layout'.

### The Search Bar

The search bar above the table gives options to filter which data you are seeing, and to add in some additional columns. 

**Restrict by date and work area**

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the search bar or the '+' icon on the right of the search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.

**Restrict by custom fields**

Once you have clicked the search bar as above, and the date and work area options are displayed, you will see a further two search bars shown below this.  The first called 'Custom field filters'.  This lets you select additional filtering options, from the fields inside your  {{referral}} record.  Click the 'Fetch data' button to show records matching these filters.

**Display additional columns**

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Clicking on here will allow you to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your work records.



**Downloading and printing the table**

If you wish to download the information you have searched for into a spreadsheet, click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table'.  Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose.
