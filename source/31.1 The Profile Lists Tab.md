# 31.1 The Profile Lists Tab

- In profiles, the {{group}}s tab has a table of the {{group}}s to which the {{person}} or {{org}} belongs. The membership of the {{group}}s is as of the last time the {{group}} was run: {{Lamplight}} does not check each time you open the tab whether this is still the case.

1. To see which {{group}}s a {{person}} or organization is a member of, click on &#039;{{Group}}s&#039; tab on their profile

2. The {{group}}s tab has a table of the {{group}}s to which the {{person}} or organisation belongs

The table shows:

- The name of the {{group}}.
- The {{group}} description - this will have been added by the person creating the {{group}} to give more detail of what it is for.
- How many people are in the {{group}} - this will show the number from the last time the {{group}} was run, so if more people have been added since then it may not be up to date. To refresh this number, select 'Quick view in popup' or 'View full details' from the {{group}}'s menu (see below).
- What type of {{group}} it is (auto, manual or merge).

- View members lets you view a list of all member of the {{group)
- To the right of 'View members' if you click on 'With a dataview', you can view the {{group}} with any Data View in your system. (see section [32 Creating and Editing Data Views](/help/index/p/13.0.0)).
- Quick view in popup: lets you view the names of other members of the {{group}}.
- Edit: opens the editing window so that you can change the filters.
- Duplicate: Creates a duplicate of this list, that you can then edit
- Convert to a manual list, removes the criteria from the Auto-list, and changes it to simple list of names that you update manually
- Delete: deletes the {{group}}. This does not remove any data from the system. If you realise that your {{group}} has been deleted in error, you can set up a new one with the same filters. (For more on setting up {{group}}s, see [27 {{Group}}s and Data Views - Finding the information You Want About Specific People](/help/index/p/27).
-{{Comm}}: you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module. It opens up a new {{comm}} record screen, with all members of the {{group}} listed as recipients (see [17 Communcations - Creating and Editing](/help/index/p/17).
- Create email to list: You'll only see this if your have the {{comm}}s module. It starts an email to profiles in that list with email addresses, who you are allowed to email.
-Print: opens a new tab in your browser where you can print the profiles of all the members of the {{group}}.
