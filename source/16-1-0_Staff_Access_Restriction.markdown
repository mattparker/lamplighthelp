# 16.1.0    {{Staff}} Access Restriction

> To ensure personnel files are kept secure and confidential a hierarchy system can be put in place. This will allow only {{staff}} members and their manager to view their full profile. 

To ensure personnel files are kept secure and confidential, you need to tell {{Lamplight}} about your management hierarchy. This will allow only {{staff}} members and their manager to view their full profile. Any other {{staff}} member who views a colleagues profile, who does not have access rights, will only be able to view the 'normal' tabs, and not the {{staff}} module tabs as mentioned in section [16.0.0  {{Staff}} Management Module - overview](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/16.0.0). A manager can have access rights to a number of {{staff}} members, and their manager will be able to see them too. Alterations to the access rights on {{staff}} files can only be done by those saved on the database as System Administrators (see section [18.6.0  System Administration - Database operators](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.0) for more information on database operators).

To make changes click on 'Admin' on the main menu, and then 'View and edit {{staff}} hierarchy' under the Manage database operators section. To set up the hierarchy, drag the {{staff}} members name onto the person that manages them. This will ensure that only that manager will be able to view their profile.

Continue to click, hold and drag {{staff}} members names onto the person that manages them to complete the full {{staff}} hierarchy.

If a {{staff}} members name is moved in error, click hold and drag it to the bottom of the page, the {{staff}} member will be added in the default position.
