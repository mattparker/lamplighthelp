# 9.1.0 Opening a New {{Linked Case}}

You can create a new {{linked case}} either through the '{{Linked Case}} View' tab in a profile, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a {{linked case}}

It is possible to open a new {{linked case}} in a couple of ways. Whichever you choose will open the same pop-up box where you will complete the details.

**Through the '{{Linked Case}} View' Tab**

Open this tab in a profile and scroll down to the bottom of this tab. There is a section called 'Create a new {{linked case}}'.

**While Linking a Record to the {{Case}}**

It is also possible to open a new {{linked case}} when you are adding records to it:
- Using the context menu from a view of {{work}} or other records, you can choose the 'Link to {{linked case}}' option. (If you do not see this option it is because it is not enabled in your system. Your System Administrator will be able to change this if required - see [16.12.4 Global Settings: Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4).) 
- This opens a new pop-up box.

- Instead of choosing an existing case from the predicted options, you can also enter the name and detalis of a new one. (For more on adding records to a {{linked case}}, see [9.2.0 Linking Records to a {{Linked Case}}](help/index/p/9.2.0).)

**Completing the New {{Linked Case}} Details**

When you have the new {{linked case}} pop-up, you will need to complete the details: 
- These will include the {{linked case}} name, (which is often the name of the {{user}}), and the date.

- You may have additional options which you can choose. These may be ones that you fill in at the start, or you may come back to them later or when you are closing the {{linked case}}. For example, in the shot above, we have an 'On completion' drop-down list which would only be filled in at the end. 
- Complete any which are relevent.  
- You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{linked case}} description'.
- Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the {{linked case}}.
