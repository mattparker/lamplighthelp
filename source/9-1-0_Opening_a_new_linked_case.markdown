# 9.1.0 Opening a New {{Linked Case}}

> 


You can create a new {{linked case}} either through the '{{Linked Case}} View' tab in a profile, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a {{linked case}}

It is possible to open a new {{linked case}} in a couple of ways. Whichever you choose will open the same pop-up box where you will complete the details.

**Through the '{{Linked Case}} View' Tab**

- Open this tab in the profile. 
- Scroll down to the bottom. There is a section called 'Create a new {{linked case}}'.

**While Linking a Record to the {{Linked Case}}**

- Using the context menu from a view of {{work}} or another record, choose the 'Link to {{linked case}}' option. (If you do not see this option it is because it is not enabled in your system. Your System Administrator will be able to change this if required - see [16.12.4 Global Settings: Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4).) 
- This opens a new pop-up box.

- Instead of choosing an existing case from the predicted options, you can also enter the name and detalis of a new one. (For more on adding records to a {{linked case}}, see [9.2.0 Linking Records to a {{Linked Case}}](help/index/p/9.2.0).)

**Completing the New {{Linked Case}} Details**

When you have the new {{linked case}} pop-up, you will need to complete the details: 
- These will include the {{linked case}} name, (which is often the name of the {{user}}), and the date.

- You may have additional options which you can choose. You may come back to edit some of these later or when you are closing the {{linked case}}. For example, in the shot above, we have an 'On completion' drop-down list as we were closing the {{linked case}}. 
- Complete any which are relevent now.  
- You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{linked case}} description'.
- Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the {{linked case}}.
