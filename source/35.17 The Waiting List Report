# 35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}

> {{Waiting list}} {{report}}s show you the number of {{people}} on your {{waiting list}}s over time and the length of time they have been on them.


The {{waiting list}} {{report}} provides a number of ways to analyse the numbers and size of your {{waiting list}}s. As with other {{Lamplight}} {{report}}s 
there are several tabs that let you define how your data is filtered and presented.

To Run a {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}:

1. Go to {{Report}}s 

2. At the top of the page you will see all the different types of {{report}} listed, select {{waiting list}} {{report}}

3. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    - view an existing {{report}} template (if there are templates set up in your system)
    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{waiting list}} {{report}} using your own criteria'

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields (you will be able to choose how these dates are
handled later on in '{{Report}} Presentation')

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 

7. The majority of these filters are the same as for other {{report}}s (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)) except
for the 'Show only waiting lists' field at the bottom which allows you to select which {{waiting list}}s you would like to report on (to
select more than one {{waiting list}} hold down ctrl on your keyboard and select the relevant {{waiting list}}s)

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

8. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data

9. The first field 'How to summarise the data' allows you to summarise the data in the following ways,

  - 'Show overall statistics for the period'
  - 'Weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'
  - 'Monthly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'

10. The second field 'How to handle dates' allows you to choose how the two dates chosen at the start of the {{report}} 
should be handled from the following options,

  - 'Show for everyone on the {{waiting list}} between the two dates'
  - 'Show for everyone added to the {{waiting list}} between the two dates'
  - 'Show for everyone removed from the {{waiting list}} between the two dates'

11. The third field 'Row data' is the same as the 'Row data' field in other reports, for more on this see [36.3 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/36.3)

12. Click 'run report'

### Projects

If you have more than one {{project}} on your system you can select which {{project}}s you would like to draw data from in this tab. See [14.1.3 {{Report}}s Across Several {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/14.1.3) for more information.

### {{Report}} Presentation

The '{{Report}} presentation' tab gives you different ways to show your data and handle the dates in your {{report}}.


#### How to Summarise the Data

You have three options:

#### Show overall statistics for the period. 

This is the default option, giving you a sense of turnover and total waiting times. It returns the following data for each {{waiting list}} selected:

  - Number of {{people}} at the start of the period: the number of {{people}} on the {{waiting list}} on the first day in the range specified.
  - Number joining the {{waiting list}} in the period: number of {{people}} added between the two dates.
  - Number leaving the {{waiting list}} in the period: number of {{people}} taken off between the two dates.
  - Total number of different {{people}}: one {{person}} may be on the same {{waiting list}} more than once in the date range, but they will only be counted once in this column. This may mean that this figure is different to the previous columns.
  - The mean time spent on {{waiting list}}: the amount of time spent on the {{waiting list}} up until the specific 'date to', averaged across everyone. This will mean that the figure changes, depending on the 'date to' that you set.
  - The mean time spent on {{waiting list}} (weekdays): a similar calculation to the one above excluding weekends (but not bank holidays etc.)

#### Weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}, or Monthly showing average size of {{waiting list}}. 

These two do the same thing, but over different time spans, showing you how demand for your services has varied week-by-week or month-by-month. This {{report}} gives you: 
  - A table listing the different {{waiting list}}s down the side, and the dates (weeks or months) along the top. 
  - Each figure in the table is the average number of {{people}} on the {{waiting list}} each week (or month). {{Lamplight}} calculates these figures by checking how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}} each day, and averaging this over the number of days in the week or month. 
  - Below that is a graph showing the same data. 
  
### How to Handle Dates

This section allows you to use the dates you've selected on the '{{Report}} filters' page in one of three ways:

#### Show for everyone on the {{waiting list}} between the two dates. 

This is the default option and will give the number of {{people}} on the {{waiting list}} at any point between the dates including:
  - {{people}} who were on it before the start and after the end date; 
  - {{people}} who were put on it during the time period; 
  - {{people}} who were on it at some point during the time period but were taken off before the end date. 

#### Show for everyone added to the {{waiting list}} between the two dates. 

This will include:
  - {{people}} who were added to the {{waiting list}} between the two dates and were still on it after the end date.
  - {{people}} who were added and left between the two dates.

#### Show for everyone removed from the {{waiting list}} between the two dates. 

This will include:
  - {{people}} who were already on the {{waiting list}} before the start date, but left between the two dates.
  - {{people}} who were added between the two dates and left again.
  
### Row Data

If you choose row data, Lamplight will add rows to your results table to show the information by this field. The options you have in the drop-down will depend on the fields in your database. For example, the table below shows the row data by 'gender'.
