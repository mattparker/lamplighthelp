# 35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}

> {{Waiting list}} {{report}}s show you the number of {{people}} on your {{waiting list}}s over time and the length of time they have been on them.


The {{waiting list}} {{report}} provides a number of ways to analyse the numbers and size of your {{waiting list}}s. As with other {{Lamplight}} {{report}}s 
there are several tabs that let you define how your data is filtered and presented.

To Run a {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}:

1. Go to {{Report}}s 
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 1](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_1.png)

2. At the top of the page you will see all the different types of {{report}} listed, select {{waiting list}} {{report}}
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 2](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_2.png)

3. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    - view an existing {{report}} template (if there are templates set up in your system)
    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 3](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_3.png)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{waiting list}} {{report}} using your own criteria'
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 4](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_4.png)

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields (you will be able to choose how these dates are
handled later on in '{{Report}} Presentation')
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 5](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_5.png)

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 6](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_6.png)

7. The majority of these filters are the same as for other {{report}}s (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)) except
for the 'Show only waiting lists' field at the bottom which allows you to select which {{waiting list}}s you would like to report on (to
select more than one {{waiting list}} hold down ctrl on your keyboard and select the relevant {{waiting list}}s)
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 7](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_7.png)

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

8. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data
![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 8](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_8.png)

9. The first field 'How to summarise the data' allows you to summarise the data in the following ways,

    - 'Show overall statistics for the period' - this is the default option, giving you a sense of turnover and total waiting 
    times and returns the following data for each {{waiting list}} selected:

        - Name of each {{waiting list}}
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 9](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_9.png)

        - Number on the {{waiting list}} at start of period: number on the {{waiting list}} on the first day in the range specified
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 10](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_10.png)

        - Number joining the {{waiting list}} in the period: number added between the two dates
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 11](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_11.png)

        - Number leaving the {{waiting list}} in the period: number taken off between the two dates
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 12](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_12.png)

        - Number on the {{waiting list}} at end of period: number on the {{waiting list}} on last day in the range specified
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 13](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_13.png)

        - Total number of different {{profile}}: one {{profile}} may be on the same {{waiting list}} more than once in the date range but they will only be counted once in this column
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 14](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_14.png)

        - Mean time spent on {{waiting list}}: the amount of time spent on the {{waiting list}} up until the specific 'date to', averaged across everyone (this figure changes depending on the 'date to' that you set)
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 15](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_15.png)

        - Mean time spent on {{waiting list}} (weekdays): a similar calculation to the one above excluding weekends (but not bank holidays etc.)
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 16](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_16.png)

        - Number of different {{profile}} on {{waiting list}} longer than the target time: for more on how to set this target time see [50.1 Waiting Lists Module Create a New Waiting {{Group}}](/help/index/p/50.1) 
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 17](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_17.png)

    - 'Weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}' - this shows you how demand for your services has varied week-by-week and returns the following data: 

        - A table listing the different {{waiting list}}s down the side and the weeks along the top
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 18](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_18.png)

        - Each figure in the table is the average number of {{people}} on the {{waiting list}} each week ({{Lamplight}} calculates these 
        figures by checking how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}} each day and averaging this over the number of days in the week)
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 19](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_19.png)

        - {{Lamplight}} also calculates the overall average, maximum value and minimum value for each week 
        ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 20](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_20.png)

    - 'Monthly showing average size of {{waiting list}}' - this shows you how demand for your services has varied month-by-month 
    and returns the same data as for 'Weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}' but for months rather than weeks
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 21](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_21.png)

10. The second field 'How to handle dates' allows you to choose how the two dates chosen at the start of the {{report}} 
should be handled from the following options,

  - 'Show for everyone on the {{waiting list}} between the two dates' - this is the default option and will give the number of 
    {{people}} on the {{waiting list}} at any point between the dates including:
        - {{People}} who were on it before the start and after the end date
        - {{People}} who were put on it during the time period
        - {{People}} who were on it at some point during the time period but were taken off before the end date
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 22](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_22.png)

  - 'Show for everyone added to the {{waiting list}} between the two dates' - this will include:
        - {{People}} who were added to the {{waiting list}} between the two dates and were still on it after the end date
        - {{People}} who were added and left between the two dates
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 23](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_23.png)

  - 'Show for everyone removed from the {{waiting list}} between the two dates' - this will include:
        - {{People}} who were already on the {{waiting list}} before the start date but left between the two dates
        - {{People}} who were added between the two dates and left again
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 24](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_24.png)

11. The third field 'Row data' is the same as the 'Row data' field in other reports, for more on this see [36.3 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/36.3)
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 25](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_25.png)

12. Click 'run report'
    ![35.17 The {{Waiting List}} {{Report}} - step 26](35.17_The_Waiting_List_Report_im_26.png)

Note, if you have more than one {{project}} on your system you will also be able to select which {{project}}s you would like to 
draw data from (for more on this see [36.2 {{Report}}s Across Several {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/36.2)).
