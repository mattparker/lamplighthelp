# 16.6.2 {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s in your system are organised so that you have a main {{outcome}} category and {{outcome}} indicators within each of these categories



Adding, editing and deleting {{outcome}}s works in the same way as for other lists, except that you have a main {{outcome}} category and {{outcome}} indicators within each category. 

You can have as many categories as you need, and each can hold any number of {{outcome}} indicators within them. For practical reasons we'd suggest no more than ten indicators in each category. 

Before you change or delete an {{outcome}} you need to consider the implications. These are the same as for {{workarea}}s - for more on this see [16.6.1 Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s and {{Subworkarea}}s](/help/index/16.6.1)).

### To Add a New {{Outcome}}
- Always remember to press enter after each field that you enter. If you do not do this, the system may hang. If this happens, click on system admin in the green toolbar, and then start again in {{outcome}}s.
- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down Lists' -> {{Outcome}}s -> {{Outcome}} measures'.
- Any {{outcome}}s already in your system will be at the top of the screen. Scroll to the end of the page and double click on 'double-click to add'.
- A text box will open, type in the title of your {{outcome}} category and press enter to save. You have now set up a new category, and will need to add the indicators to it.

### To Add Indicators/Questions to an {{Outcome}}
- Double-click on the text 'double-click to add' immediately under the category name you just entered, and type in the text for your indicator. Press 'enter' to save. 
- '{{Outcome}} type'. Double-click on this and a drop-down list will appear. This offers you:
  - 'score': Choose this if you're using a scale system (for example a scale of 1-10) to record your {{outcome}}s.
  - 'yes/no'.
  - 'number': This is for recording specific amounts (for example, if you're using this to show debt-reduction it could be from 50,000 to 0). 
- 'Notes': Double click to open the notes section to add any explanatory notes for operators, then click enter to save.

- 'Min/MaxValue: Use these to set your minimum and maximum values (e.g. as above, your scale might be 1 (minimum) and 10 (maximum)). If you're creating a yes/no {{outcome}} use the minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 1. Press enter to save.
- Continue these steps until you have added all the measures that you need.

### Editing {{Outcome}}s
Before you make any changes, you need to be aware of the implications of editing an {{outcome}}. For more on this see 'Things to Consider' in [16.6.1 System Administration: Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/p/16.6.1).

- To edit an {{outcome}}, double-click on the text you wish to edit.
- Make the changes. 
- Press enter on your keyboard to save. 

### Deleting {{Outcome}}s
Before you delete an {{outcome}} you need to be aware of the implications. For more on this see 'Things to Consider' in [16.6.1 System Administration: Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/p/16.6.1).

- You can delete either a whole {{outcome}} category, or specific measures within a category.  
- Either click at the top next to the category name (to delete the category), or next to the indicator text (for an individual indicator). 
- Hold down the mouse button and drag it to the grey ‘Drag here to delete’ box at the foot of the page.
- Release the mouse button to drop it in the box.
