# 16.6.2    {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s in your system are organised so that you have a main outcome category and outcome indicators within each of these categories. 

You can have as many {{outcome}} categories as you need, and each can hold any number of {{outcome}} indicators within them. For practical reasons we'd suggest no more than ten indicators in each category. 

In system administration, the {{outcome}} category is displayed in bold with any  {{outcome}} indicators relating to it listed below.

**To add a new {{outcome}}**

- Always remember to press enter after each field that you enter. If you do not do this, the system may hang. If this happens, click on system admin in the green toolbar, and then start again in {{outcome}}s.
- Go to admin on the main menu and click system administration.
- Under the manage drop-down lists section, click on {{outcome}}s.
- Scroll to the bottom of the page and double click over the double-click to add.
- A text box will open, type in the title of your {{outcome}} category and press enter to save.
- In the {{outcome}} indicator box, double-click over the text 'double-click to add'.
- In the text box which has opened, type in the name of the {{outcome}} indicator and press 'enter' on your keyboard to save.
- You can score {{outcome}}s in different ways; a scale system, yes/no and numerical. Double click over the option and a drop-down list will appear, click on your selection.

- Double click to open the notes section to add any explanatory notes, click enter to save. 
- Set a minimum and maximum value. If you are creating a yes/no {{outcome}} use the minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 1. Again, press enter to save.

**Editing and deleting outcomes**

To edit and delete, follow the guidelines as detailed in section [18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/v/18.2.1).

When deleting, make sure to delete each {{outcome}} indicator in turn, before deleting the {{outcome}} category box.
