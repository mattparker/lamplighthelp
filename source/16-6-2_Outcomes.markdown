# 16.6.2    {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s in your system are organised so that you have a main outcome category and outcome indicators within each of these categories. 

Outcomes work in the same way as other lists, except that you have a main {{outcome}} and {{outcome}} indicators within each category. 

You can have as many {{outcome}} categories as you need, and each can hold any number of {{outcome}} indicators within them. For practical reasons we'd suggest no more than ten indicators in each category. 

You can add a whole new {{outcome}} or just add indicators to existing ones.

In system administration, the {{outcome}} category is displayed in bold with any  {{outcome}} indicators relating to it listed below. 

![{{Outcome}} categories]({{imgpath}}186a.png)

Before you change or delete an {{outcome}} you need to consider the implications. These are the same as for {{workarea}}s - for more on this see xxxxxxx.

**To add a new {{outcome}}**

- Always remember to press enter after each field that you enter. If you do not do this, the system may hang. If this happens, click on system admin in the green toolbar, and then start again in {{outcome}}s.
- Go to admin on the main menu and click system administration.
- Under the manage drop-down lists section, click on {{outcome}}s.
- Scroll to the very bottom of the page and double click over the double-click to add.
- A text box will open, type in the title of your {{outcome}} category and press enter to save.

**To Add Indicators/Questions to an {{Outcome}}

- In the {{outcome}} indicator box, double-click over the text 'double-click to add'.

- In the text box which has opened, type in the name of the {{outcome}} indicator and press 'enter' on your keyboard to save.
- Double click over 'Outcome type' and a drop-down list will appear. You can score {{outcome}}s in different ways: a scale system (for example a scale of 1-10), yes/no, and numerically (for example, if you're using this to show debt-reduction it could be from 50,000 to 0). Click on your selection.

- Double click to open the notes section to add any explanatory notes for operators, then click enter to save. 
- Set a minimum and maximum value (e.g. as above, your scale might be 1 (minimum) and 10 (maximum)). If you are creating a yes/no {{outcome}} use the minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 1. Press enter to save.
- Continue these steps until all measures that you need are added.

**Editing {{Outcome}}s**

Before you make any changes, you need to be aware of the implications of editing an {{outcome}}. For more on this see XXXXXXXX.

- To edit an {{outcome}}, double-click on the text you wish to change and edit.
- Make the changes. 
- Press enter on your keyboard to save. To edit and delete, follow the guidelines as detailed in section [18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/p/18.2.1).

**Deleting {{Outcome}}s**

Before you delete an {{outcome}} you need to be aware of the implications. For more on this see XXXXXXXX.

- When deleting, make sure to delete each {{outcome}} indicator in turn, before deleting the {{outcome}} category box. 
- To delete an {{outcome}}, left click the indicator and hold the mouse button down to drag it to the grey ‘Drag here to delete’ box at the bottom of the page.
- Release the mouse button to drop it in the box.
