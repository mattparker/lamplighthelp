# 27.4.0 Multimedia Module: Viewing Storage Usage

> 5 GB of storage per {{project}} is included each month as part of the module cost. You can keep track of how much has been used in system administration, and you can purchas additional storage as necessary

### Storage Limits

Every piece of information you save in Lamplight will take up storage space. High resolution images or long films can be particularly large.

5GB of storage per {{project}} is included each month as part of the module cost, and additional storage can be purchased if required. Images and films you link to from other sites will not take up any storage space.

You should agree as an organisation what information you will be saving to your profiles, and what should and should not be indexed.

### Viewing Your Storage Use

You can see how much of your data allowance you have used within your system.
- Go to admin -> system administration, and then 'manage media settings - view file storage and allowance'. 
- You will see the current usage for each of the projects you have access to.

- Total storage space is combined across {{project}}s, so if one goes over it automatically 'borrows' space from another {{project}} that has spare capacity.
