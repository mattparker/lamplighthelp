# 31.1.0 Listing {{Recruiter}} campaigns

> A {{Recruiter}} campaign shows the current campaigns you have, and where you create a new one.
> Go to '{{people}} > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns' on the main menu.

To get starting with the {{recruiter}} module, and go to 'people > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns' on the 
main menu.  From here you'll see existing campaigns and their status, and buttons to carry out 
key actions.

##SCREENSHOT##

The buttons at the top of the screen take you directly to common actions you'll need to perform
as part of your recruitment.  Below that, existing campaigns are listed, grouped together
by their status.

Campaign status will be one of:
 - campaign not started (the Applications Open date is in the future)
 - campaign under way (applications are open)
 - shortlisting underway (the closing date has been reached and panel members can access them)
 - shortlisting complete (final scores and decisions have been made)

The actions available to you will depend on the status of the campaign.  For example,
you cannot edit campaigns once they are under way and you've received any applications, 
and you can't start shortlisting until after the closing date.

## Campaigns Not Started

Campaigns not started have an open date in the future, and if you visit the URL you will see an error
message.  Campaigns that haven't started can be edited, deleted, and duplicated.

## Campaigns Under Way

Campaigns under way means that you can accept applications: the campaign has started and the closing
date is in the future.  You'll see the URL for the campaign in the listing - this is the URL
that you should advertise to potential applicants.

You can see a summary of how the campaign is going - the number of responses you've received so far. 
However you are not able to view applications or reporting.

## Shortlisting underway

Campaigns in the shortlisting phase have passed their closing date, and panel members have not finished
scoring responses.

If you're a member of the panel you'll see a summary of where you've got to, and a button to enable you to
score responses.

## Shortlisting complete

Once shortlisting is complete you'll be able to view scores made by the panel.

While you are making a final decision you won't see applicant names; once you have done and confirmed
the decision, you will be able to see names and access their profiles.
