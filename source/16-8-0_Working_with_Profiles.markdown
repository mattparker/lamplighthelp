# 16.8.0 Working with Profiles

> System Administrators can merge duplicate profiles as well as archiving and deleting records that are no longer actively needed



[Profile in {{Lamplight}}](16.8.0a.png)

There may be profiles on your system that you no longer need. You have three options for what you can do with these:

- If it is a duplicate profile, and you want all the records to be in one place, then you can merge the two profiles together (see [16.8.1 Merging Profiles](/help/index/p/16.8.1)).
- If it is a {{person}} that you have finished working with and do not want to add any more information or records to, but you do want to be able to report on the work that has been done with them, then you can archive them (see [16.8.2 Archiving Profiles](/help/index/p/16.8.1)).
- If it is a profile that you would like to permanently remove from your system, with the option to get rid of demographic data and {{activity}} records too, then you can delete them (see [16.8.3 Deleting a Profile](/help/index/p/16.8.3)).
