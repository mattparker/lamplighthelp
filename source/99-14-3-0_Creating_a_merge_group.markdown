# 14.3.0    Creating a {{merge group}}

> A {{merge group}} is a {{group}} which is created by combining the members of existing {{group}}s together. 

{{Merge group}}s change as their component {{group}}s change.  They also remove any duplicates, so if one {{person}} or organisation is present in two or more of the consitituent {{group}}s they will only appear once in the merge {{group}}. They can be used in the same way that {{manual group}} and {{auto group}}s are.

On the main menu go to {{Group}}s -> add -> add {{merge group}}s. You will need to give the {{group}} a name and description.

After that, on the '{{Group}}s' tab start typing the name of the first {{group}} that you want to include in your {{merge group}}.  When you find it, click to add it to the table. Continue to find the {{group}}s you want to include until all have been added, then click Save.
