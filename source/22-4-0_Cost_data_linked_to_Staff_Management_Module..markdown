# 22.4.0    Cost Data Linked to the Staff Management Module.

> The Costing Module can be linked to the Staff Management Module to allow the {{staff}} cost connected to a {{work}} record to be calculated. 

**Calulating Staffing Costs**

Within the Staff Management Module, hourly wages for different members of staff can be entered into the contract details tab within their profile. This information is then used when a {{work}} record is created so that the total staff cost involved in running the piece of {{work}} is calculated.

The calculation will be automatic, provided that:

- The {{staff}} member's hourly wage has been entered into their profile, and that the contract period covers the date of the {{work}} record.
- The {{staff}} member has been added to the attendance list.
- The {{staff}} member's attendance type is 'attended' and their role is 'staff'.

If this has been set up, you can run a {{work}} report to show you the costs (this will include staffing and expenses) of the {{work}} that you have done. When running the report simply choose 'Cost data' from the 'Data to show' list on the report presentation tab. (For more on running reports please see XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).

**Authorising Expenses**

The {{staff}} hierarchy also works in connection with authorisation levels for expenses. You are only able to authorise/pay expenses for people that you manage. Your system administrator will have organised the hierarchy in your system. Please speak with them if you are uncertain about this.
