# 26.2.2 Matching Module - Creating {{volunteering application}} records

> {{Volunteering application}} records are created in the profiles of the applicant.

To add a {{volunteering application}} record, go to the profile of the applicant and click the '{{volunteering application}}' tab.  You will see any previous {{volunteering application}} records.  Click the 'Add' button to create a new record.

### When and where

Complete the 'when and where' tab as you would for other {{activity}} records.  However note that the 'location' selected here is unrelated to the matching process to {{volunteering opportunity}} records, which uses the address of the {{person}}.

### {{Volunteering application}} details

On this tab you record when the {{person}} is available, and what they'd like to do.

Complete the availability details: this can be used to [match to {{volunteering opportunity}} records](/help/index/p/26.4.0).

The categories are the same as appear in the {{volunteering opportunity}} records, and again can be used to match records.

When you are done click the 'save' button.
