# 26.2.2 Matching Module - Creating {{Volunteering Application}} Records

> {{Volunteering application}} records are created for each applicant to show their skills, availability, location and interests. You can find them in each {{volunteer}}'s profile

To add a {{volunteering application}} record, go to the profile of the applicant and click the '{{volunteering application}}' tab.  If there are any existing {{volunteering application}} for this {{person}} you will see them here.  Click the 'Add' button to create a new one.

### When and Where

Complete the 'When and where' tab as you would for other {{activity}} records.  However, if you select a 'location' here it will not be used for matching to {{volunteering opportunity}}s as {{Lamplight}} uses the address saved in their 'Contact details' for this.

### {{Volunteering Application}} Details

On this tab you record when the {{person}} is available, and what they'd like to do.

Complete the availability details and the text boxes which give more details of any preferences, requirements and practical considerations (these can be used to narrow down the most suitable opportunities when [matching to {{volunteering opportunity}} records](/help/index/p/26.4.0)).

The checkbox categories below this are the same as appear in the {{volunteering opportunity}} records, so they can be used to automatically match skills, interests and specific {{volunteer} requirements.

When you have finished click the 'save' button.
