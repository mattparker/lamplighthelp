# 4.1.2 Changing What You See in Your Diary

> It is possible to customise your diary so that you only see appointments relating to particular {{staff}} and {{workarea}}s. You can also print off your diary


There are a number of options in your diary where you can customise the diary and the records that you see.

### {{Workarea}}s

Under the diary there is a list of the different {{workarea}} in your system. It will look something like this:

![{{Workarea}}s in the Diary](4.1.2a.png)

You can tick and untick the checkboxes so that you will only see {{work}} records related to the {{workarea}}s that you specify.

### Locations

Underneath the list of {{workarea}}s is one of the locations that you have in your system.

Again, you can tick and untick the checkboxes to customise the location of the records that you see in the diary. 

### Colour Scheme

By default the appointments in the diary are coloured according the {{workarea}} that they belong to. There is an option under the {{workarea}} and location lists which allows you to change this to be coloured by the location that they are happening in.

This allows you to see at a glance where an {{activity}} is happening, and can be particularly useful when checking if there is a room free at a specific time, for example.

### {{Staff}} Attending

If you only want to see the appointments that relate to particular {{staff}}, there is a box on the right under the diary which lists the {{staff} that are on your system. 

![Diary {{Staff}} attending](4.1.2d.png)

You can tick and untick the checkboxes to customise whose appointments you would like to see when looking at the diary. If you work in a particular team you may only want to see what they are doing, for example.

### Show/Hide Items

Under the diary to the left of the screen, there is the option to 'show/hide items'. What you see here depends on whether you have the Staffing Module. 

![Diary Show Hide Items](4.1.2e.png)

Everyone has the ability to turn off {{work}} records in the diary (this will mean that there is nothing visible in 'Diary' view, and if you are using {{message}}s then you can turn these off so that you do not see them in 'My Diary' (they never appear in the main 'Diary' option.)

For users with the Staffing Module you will also have options to turn off training, absence, appraisal and non-contact work records in the diary. 

### Other Things

There are two more options below the diary. 

![Diary Other Things](4.1.2f.png)

Clicking on the first, 'print diary', takes you to a printer-friendly page. This will open a new tab in your browser showing whichever view you were in when you pressed the button - either day, week or month.

If you have customised the diary, for example changing the {{workarea}}s or {{staff}} records that you will see, the 'save settings' button will save this for you. The next time you come to view your diary it will be the same customised version.

If you'd like to see a demonstration of the diary, you can watch our 'Homepage Diary and Tabs' video.
