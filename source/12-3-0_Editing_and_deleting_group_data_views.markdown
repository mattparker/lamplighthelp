# 12.3.0 Editing and Deleting {{Group}} Data Views

> Once you have saved a {{group}} data view it is possible to go back and edit it to show extra information, or to delete it altogether 

To view a list of all the {{group}} data views on your system:
- Click '{{Group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> view'. 
- A screen similar to the one below will show:

![{{Group}} data view](112a.png )

- Find the data view that you want to edit or delete, and right-click on it. 
- From the pop-up context menu, choose either 'Edit' if you want to make changes, or 'Delete' if you want to remove it from your system. 

**Data views are a way of viewing the data in your system. Deleting them does not delete any of the data from your system.**
