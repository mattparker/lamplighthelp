# 2.2.1 Log-in Problems

> The most common problems that people have when logging in are when they are entering a username or password which {{Lamplight}} does not recognise

If you enter a username or password which is not stored in {{Lamplight}}, two things may happen. 

### Login Failed

If the database does not recognise your username, you will see a 'login failed' error message below the sign-in boxes.

You will see the same message if your password is not recognised.

If this problem persists, you may need to change your password or check with your System Administrator that you are using the correct username. For more on changing your password see section [16.1.0 Changing Passwords](help/index/p/16.1.0).


### Locked Out

You may also see a message that you are locked out of the sytsem.

This could be because you’ve tried to log in to your account ten times without success. Failed attempts don’t all have to be at once, so can be across several sessions, days or weeks. 

The other reason for a lockout is when your System Administrator has set up login security policies which mean that you can't log in at this time or from the IP address of the computer that you are using.

If you see this message please see your System Admnistrator who will be able to unlock your account. Once it has been unlocked you will only have one chance to log in correctly before being locked out again. This is a security feature to stop unauthroised access to your account. If you fail to log in correctly the first time, you will need to ask your System Administrator to unlock the account again. Once you have successfully logged in to your account, the counter is reset to ten failed log-in attempts before you are locked out again.

There is information on lockouts in section for System Administrators on unlocking an account in section [16.2.0 System Administration: Lockouts](help/index/p/16.2.0).
