4. Name your {{group}} and write a {{group}} description as they are both a requirement
- Add a name and description of the {{group}} which will help you and other users of the system remember what it is for. The {{group}} will be available for other operators who have access to your system.
- If it is important that you are the only person and System Administrators who can add and remove people from the {{group}}, tick the 'lock this {{group}} for editing' box. That way you can be sure it hasn't changed without you knowing.
