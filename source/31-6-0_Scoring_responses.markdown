# 31.6.0 Scoring {{Recruiter_applicant}} responses

> After the closing date for the campaign, members of the shortlisting panel need to score the responses.
> To do this go to {{person}} > {{recruiter}} > list campaigns and select 'Score responses' for the campaign.

Each member of the shortlisting panel should score responses separately.  To do so, they will need to 
go to {{person}} > {{recruiter}} > list campaigns.  After the closing date, members of the panel will see
the 'Score responses' button.

## Summary status

They will then see a table showing how many responses they have scored for each question.

You can click on any question if you want to review scores you've already made, or enter new scores.

When you do you'll see the responses to that question, with the Mark Scheme notes alongside (if any have
been set up).  The responses are presented in a random order, so you can't link responses from one
question to the next and assume they are the same person.

Read through each question, comparing it to the Mark Scheme, and select your score.

You can save your scores at any time, but we recommend scoring all responses in one sitting to ensure
that you can compare all responses fairly.
