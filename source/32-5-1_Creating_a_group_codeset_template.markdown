# 32.5.1 Creating a template using a {{Group}}, data view and CodeSet

> Creating a template means that you can produce your report in one click and maintain consistency when you have to run the same report regularly. 

To create a template a system admin will need to go to admin > system administration > manage {{group}} and data view
templates.

You'll see any templates you have already created, which can be edited or deleted, or create a new one.  Either
edit or create a new template and you'll see the following options:



Select the {{group}}, data view, and CodeSet you wish to use.  You can also lock the template, which prevents other
system admins from changing these settings, although anyone with access to reports will be able to run it.
Also, locking does not lock the {{group}} or data view - you may wish to do this in addition to prevent any
unwanted changes to your report.

Once you have created a template, reload Lamplight to return to the home page.  On  the main menu under 
{{group}}s > view you wil see the template you just created.  Click on the template and you'll jump straight to the results.

You may need to show or hide certain columns, or change the order of them.  Having used the template so that you can
see the results, re-arrange the columns by drag-and-drop and using the column menu, and then 'save table layout'.   Now when
you come to use the template you should see the columns as you need them.
