# 7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details

Once you have created a {{work}} record you will need to add details to it.

### When and where
1. The first section is “When and where”.

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 1](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_1.png)

2. Add the start date and time using the calendar button, or manually editing them

The date and time on a {{work}} record is required. It will be used to add the record to the homepage diary, and also in calculations of how long sessions have taken when reporting. 

When you select the start time the end time will automatically change. The default length of work records is one hour, but this may have been changed in your system. When you set the date, {{Lamplight}} will change the 'to' date so that it matches the 'from' one. This will usually be the case, unless you are working into the small hours of the morning, or counting an overnight stay as work. If it is a session which resumes over a number of days - a week of training for example - this can be set up as a recurring record. For more on this see [7.2 Recurring {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.2).

3. Select the correct workarea for the record

You must select a {{workarea}} (it is only possible to choose one), and any number of {{subworkarea}}s.

To add a {{workarea}}, click on the appropriate radio button / {{workarea}}. The {{subworkarea}}s will appear in a pop-out box to the side of this. Choose any {{subworkarea}} checkboxes which apply.

5. Add the location if needed/set up in your system

You can select as many as you need. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect. These let you view your {{activity}} records by location in the diary, as well as being used as a filter in {{report}}s.
![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 4](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_4.png)

5. Click “Next” at the bottom right of the screen, or click right onto “Attendance” at the top of the section to move on to adding attendees

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 5](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_5.png)

### Attendance
The attendance tab records details of everyone who is involved with a particular session. As well as {{user}}s, this can include {{staff}}, {{volunteer}}s or other contacts. If you are entering details in advance, you can record people as booked. It can even include details of people who were expected to attend but did not for some reason. This means that you can look back and report on different people's involvement. 

The {{work}} record will appear in the {{work}} records tab of anyone included in the attendance table.

6. Start typing the name of the attendee you want to add in the ‘Profiles to add to the attendance {{group}}’ box

If you are creating the work record in a profile, the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile it is will already be listed in the attendance table as a {{user}}. You may also be there as {{staff}}

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 6](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_6.png)

8. When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches.

When the name you want appears under the box, click on it to add it to the attendance table. You can repeat these steps to add as many {{people}} as you need.

If they do not show up on the drop-down menu click the 'add new people to database' button on the right - see [7.1.1 {{Work}} Records: Adding New Profiles Via the Attendance Table](/help/index/p/7.1.1). 

If you have already set up a {{group}} and you would like to add the members of it to the table in bulk, follow the instructions above, searching for the name of the {{group}}. When you choose the {{group}} name from the list, the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table

### Removing a {{Person}} or {{Org}} from the Attendance Table  

To remove someone added in error click the delete box which is in the final column of the table on the right. This will only remove them from the table, not the database.

### Changing Attendance Roles  

To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person:
- Click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear.

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 7](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_7.png)

### Adding Notes to the Attendance Table  

There is also the option to add any further notes concerning the individual attendees. 
- Click in the notes box along from their name.
- Add any text you need into the box.
- Click save to exit.

### Custom Columns  

You may see more columns in your table. These will be ones that are unique to your organisation, customised for the work that you do. If you are unsure how to complete these, please ask your System Administrator.

### Adding Unknown Attendees  

The box below the attendance table is called 'Number of unknown {{people}} attending'. This lets you put in a number, but no details of people that attended who are unknown to you. You might need this for a large public event, for example. If you use this feature, when you report they will be counted as a number of attendances, but not unique individuals because there is no way to check whether you would be double counting the anonymous individuals in different sessions. 


8. When you’ve finished adding attendees, click on the Details tab at the top of the record to move on

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 8](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_8.png)

### Details
9. Add the title of the session to the ‘Summary’ box. This is what will appear in the Homepage diary

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 9](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_9.png)

10. The 'Description' field is a text box which is usually used to enter notes on the detail of the session. If you're creating a record in advance, you may want to come back and fill this in late

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 10](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_10.png)

11. Follow up details can be added to the ‘Follow up’ box. Note – this is a free text box, so your {{org}} may use it slightly differently

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 11](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_11.png)

**Custom Fields**
12. You may have extra fields/tabs in your {{work}} record to fill in at this point in your system.

If you are unsure how to complete these, please ask your System Administrator. When you’ve added all the information you need.

Click Save at the bottom of the page, or ‘Save and view record’ at the top. This will also add it to your diary
