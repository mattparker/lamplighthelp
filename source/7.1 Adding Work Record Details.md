# 7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details

Once you have created a {{work}} record you will need to add details to it.

### When and where
1. The first section is “When and where”.

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 1](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_1.png)

2. Add the start date and time using the calendar button, or manually editing them

The date and time on a {{work}} record is required. It will be used to add the record to the homepage diary, and also in calculations of how long sessions have taken when reporting. 

When you select the start time the end time will automatically change. The default length of work records is one hour, but this may have been changed in your system. When you set the date, {{Lamplight}} will change the 'to' date so that it matches the 'from' one. This will usually be the case, unless you are working into the small hours of the morning, or counting an overnight stay as work. If it is a session which resumes over a number of days - a week of training for example - this can be set up as a recurring record. For more on this see [7.2 Recurring {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.2).

3. Select the correct workarea for the record
You must select a {{workarea}} (it is only possible to choose one), and any number of {{subworkarea}}s.
To add a {{workarea}}, click on the appropriate radio button / {{workarea}}. The {{subworkarea}}s will appear in a pop-out box to the side of this. Choose any {{subworkarea}} checkboxes which apply.

5. Add the location if needed/set up in your system
You can select as many as you need. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect. These let you view your {{activity}} records by location in the diary, as well as being used as a filter in {{report}}s.

## Attendance
6. Start typing the name of the attendee you want to add in the ‘Profiles to add to the attendance {{group}}’ box

7. When the name you want appears under the box, click on it to add it to the attendance table. You can repeat these steps to add as many {{people}} as you need.
If they do not show up on the drop-down menu click the 'add new people to database' button on the right - see [7.1.1 {{Work}} Records: Adding New Profiles Via the Attendance Table](/help/index/p/7.1.1).

### Details
9. Add the title of the session to the ‘Summary’ box. This is what will appear in the Homepage diary

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 9](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_9.png)

10. The 'Description' field is a text box which is usually used to enter notes on the detail of the session. If you're creating a record in advance, you may want to come back and fill this in late

11. Follow up details can be added to the ‘Follow up’ box. Note – this is a free text box, so your {{org}} may use it slightly differently

![7.1 Adding {{Work}} Record Details - step 11](7.1_Adding_Work_Record_Details_im_11.png)

12. You may have extra tabs in your {{work}} record to fill in at this point. When you’ve added all the information you need.

Click Save at the bottom of the page, or ‘Save and view record’ at the top. This will also add it to your diary
