# 22.2.0 {{Eval}}s Module: Entering and Editing {{Eval}} Responses

> When you have completed {{eval}}s, they will need to be entered into {{Lamplight}}. The responses can be linked to specific profiles or left anonymous



### Entering Responses 

- Go to {{work}}-> add new-> {{eval}}.  A side menu appears listing the {{eval}}s templates you have in your system
- Click on the {{eval}} you wish to enter information for. 
- The following screen will appear:

- The 'when and where' and 'attendance' tabs are the same as those for {{work}} records and {{outcome}}s (see section [7.1.1  When and Where](/help/index//p/7.1.1) and [7.1.2  Adding Attendance Details to a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.2) for more details). 
- If you would like your {{eval}}s to be anonymous you can leave the attendance table blank. However, if you do this you will not be able to view the {{eval}} results in that {{user}}'s profile, and when running {{report}}s you will not be able to use any demographics from profiles to inform the report. 
- The third tab will show title of your {{eval}}. When you click on this, you will see the questions for this {{eval}}:

- Complete the answers to the questions, 
- Click the 'save' button in the bottom right. 
- You will now see the saved {{eval}}. 

### Editing Responses

You can edit responses once they have been added:

- Find the {{eval}} you would like to change, either in {{work}} -> view -> {{eval}}s, or in the profile of the person that it is linked to (you will not be able to do this if the {{eval}} has been entered anonymously - see above).
- Left-click on the menu button to the left, or right-click on the table-row.
- Choose 'edit'.
- This will open up the record for you to alter the details as needed. 
- Click on save when you have finished.
