# 33.2.2 Assigning Investigators

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers need to assign investigators to a {{safeguarding case}}. They can assign any member of staff to the
> {{safeguarding case}}, and then that person will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}}.

When a new {{safeguarding case}} has been raised, the first thing that needs to happen is for a {{safeguarding}} manager to review the
{{safeguarding case}}, and assign one or more investigators to it. Investigators may be any database operator, including the
{{safeguarding}} manager.

Once someone has been assigned they will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}}, and be able to add records to it, see all
records, and change the status and other aspects of it.

To assign an investigator, go to the list of all {{safeguarding case}}s and click to view details. Below the main information panel
are a series of actions that are available to you. For a newly raised {{safeguarding case}} the actions are fairly limited.

Select the name of the investigator and click ‘save’. You will see that their name is now listed In the main information
panel. You will also see that the status of the {{safeguarding case}} has been automatically updated to ‘under investigation’.

Now that the {{safeguarding case}} is under investigation, the available actions have changed. These are covered in the next section.

If you need to assign additional investigators you can do so now or at any time. Simply select their name from the list
of names.

It may be that on reviewing the {{safeguarding case}} you judge that no further action is required. In this case you need not assign
an investigator, or you could assign yourself. We suggest that you document your reasons for the decision now, and then
update the status of the {{safeguarding case}} to closed.
