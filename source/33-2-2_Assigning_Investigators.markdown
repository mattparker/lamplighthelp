# 33.2.2 Assigning {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers need to assign {{safeguarding lead contact}}s to a {{safeguarding case}}. They can assign any member of staff to the {{safeguarding case}}, and then that person will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}}.

When a new {{safeguarding case}} has been raised, the first thing that needs to happen is for a {{safeguarding}} manager to review the
{{safeguarding case}}, and assign one or more {{safeguarding lead contact}}s to it. {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s may be any database operator, including the
{{safeguarding}} manager. They do need a valid email address on their profile to receive notifications.

Your system administrator may have set Lamplight to automatically assign the person raising the {{safeguarding case}} 
as a {{safeguarding lead contact}}. If so you will see them listed on the concern, but may wish to review this.

Once someone has been assigned they will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}}, and be able to add records to it, see all
records, and change the status and other aspects of it.

To assign a {{safeguarding lead contact}}, go to the list of all {{safeguarding case}}s and click to view details. Below the main information panel
are a series of actions that are available to you. For a newly raised {{safeguarding case}} the actions are fairly limited.

Select the name of the {{safeguarding lead contact}} and click ‘save’. You will see that their name is now listed In the main information
panel. You will also see that the status of the {{safeguarding case}} has been automatically updated to 'Internal Fact Gathering'.

Now that the {{safeguarding case}} has been assigned, the available actions have changed. These are covered in 
[section 33.2.3](/en/help/p/33.2.2).

If you need to assign additional {{safeguarding lead contact}}s you can do so now or at any time. Simply repeat the process, 
selecting their name from the list of operators.

It may be that on reviewing the {{safeguarding case}} you judge that no further action is required. In this case you need not assign
a {{safeguarding lead contact}}, or you could assign yourself. We suggest that you document your reasons for the decision now, and then
update the status of the {{safeguarding case}} to closed.
