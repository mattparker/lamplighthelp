# 16.7.3 Which Custom Fields to Choose in {{activity}} records

> Custom tabs and fields can be added to activity records to allow you to capture additional information that you may need to record about what is happening. 

STILL VERY MUCH IN PROCESS Need a desripton of what the different reporting options mean with links

Before you decide which types of field to add you need to think carefully the information you want to capture, and how you will need to report on it. See the table below for more information on this.

**Reporting on custom fields**

There are a number of different ways in which custom fields in profiles can be used to report on. Depending on the type of field that you choose you will be able to:

- Use it to filter reports: this allows you restrict the results you see based on the field. For example, if you have added a field called 'Team', with the options 'Youth', 'Older People' and 'Working Age Parents', you could then filter the report so that it only shows you the results for activity records which have chosen the 'Youth' team. (For more on filtering reports, see XXXXXXXXX).
- Use it for presenting reports: this allows you to show columns in a report using this field. So using the above example, you could run a report on the number of {{work}} sessions you've had in the last six months, and then choose to present it by your 'Team' field. This would then give you a column or row for each of the options in that field - 'Youth', 'Older People' and 'Working Age Parents', so that you could see the results for each different group at a glance. (For more on report presentation see XXXXXXXXX).
- For creating {{group}}s: again, using the above field example you can create auto-{{group}}s to show you everyone who has attended a {{work}} session that was tagged with 'Older People' in the last six months. (For more on {{auto group}}s see XXXXXXXXX).
- For creating {{group} data views: you could set up a {{group}} data view to show you the number of times a person had attended a {{work}} record tagged as 'Youth' in the last two years. (For more on {{group}} data views please see XXXXXXXXX.)
- Add as a column in a record table: you can view tables of records from the main menu (to find out more please see XXXXX). In this example, you could use the search bar above the table to add in a column showing for each of the options.

**Types of custom field**

The table below gives details of how each custom field works, and how you can use each type of field to report on. 
**Please note: if you add a custom field or tab to {{Outcomes}} records, this will only be visible if you add a column to the table of {{outcomes}} records. It is not possible to report on this in any other way.**
