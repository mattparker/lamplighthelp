# 4.1.1 Diary Navigation

> Use the icons in the top-right of the diary to change dates or view 

You can use the calendar navigation toolbar, which is found in the top right corner of the diary, to change what dates are displayed.

In order from left to right, the buttons:

  1. Go to previous day or week.
  2. Show the popup calendar to jump to a particular day/week.
  3. Jump to today (or the current week).
  4. Change the view (from week to month; from month to week; or from day to week).
  5. Go to the next day or week.

To select a single day to view, click on the header of the day that you would like to see. So if in this example you click on Monday March 25:

that day will open on its own:

![Diary - single day veiw](help/index/p/4.1.1c)

You can find a practical demonstration of the diary in our video, 'Homepage Diary and Tabs'.
