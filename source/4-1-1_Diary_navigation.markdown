You can use the calendar navigation toolbar, which is found in the top right corner of the diary, to change what dates are displayed.

In order from left to right, the buttons:

  <span style="color: red;">1.</span> Go to previous day or week.
  
  <span style="color: red;">2.</span> Show the popup calendar to jump to a particular day/week.
  
  <span style="color: red;">3.</span> Jump to today (or the current week).
  
  <span style="color: red;">4.</span> Change the view (from week to month; from month to week; or from day to week).
  
  <span style="color: red;">5.</span> Go to the next day or week.

To select a single day to view, click on the header of the day that you would like to see. If in this example you click on Monday March 25:

that day will open on its own:

You can find a practical demonstration of the diary in our video, 'Homepage Diary and Tabs'.
