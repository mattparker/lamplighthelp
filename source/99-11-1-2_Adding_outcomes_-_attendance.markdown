# 11.1.2    Adding {{outcome}}s - attendance (Respondent)

> Enter details of who the {{outcome}}(s) involve. 

The attendance tab records details of everyone for whom this {{outcome}} applies. Mostly this is likely to be a single {{person}}. However, there may be times when you need to enter these in bulk, for example if a group of {{people}} have achieved a training qualification that you wish to record. 

You can also record outcomes for members of {{staff}} or others on the system.

To add additional {{people}}, start typing their name in the box. When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches: select the name you are looking for. They will be added to the table.

You can also add members of a {{group}} in bulk: start typing the name of the {{group}} in the search box and you will see matching {{group}}s too. If you click on a {{group}} the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.

To alter the role for a particular {{person}}, click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear. Select the appropriate option. Your system administrator can add options to these lists (see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0) ).

To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This will check and then remove them from the table. 

__Simple attendance table__

Some systems will use the simple attendance table, which is differentiated by the tab being called Respondent.  This follows the same principle, but gives you two simple options as below.  (The simple setting can be selected in Global settings by your system administrator.)
