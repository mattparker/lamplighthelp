# 23.0.0    {{Eval}}s Direct Module

> The {{Eval}}s Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, to allow you to create online links to your existing survey/{{eval}} data, which you can send to your end users to complete.  This module us known as DataDirect in Lamplight.

Using Lamplight, you can send out one link to everyone, or a different link to each person, tracking who has responded, and with what information, using the evaluations module.  The information they complete is entered automatically into Lamplight, and ready for your analysis.

To do this you set-up an {{eval}}s Direct campaign, that identifies which evaluation you will be using, who you want to send it to, and when.
