# 32.6.0 Using Report CodeSets with {{activity}} listings

> Use a CodeSet with an {{activity}} listing to transform the source data to your required output.  Go to {{Activity}}s > View > {{work}} > standard {{work}} listing and select your CodeSet.

Once you have created a CodeSet you can start to use it with {{activity}} views to change the 
data output.  Go to {{Activity}}s > View > {{work}} > standard {{work}} listing on the main menu. Click 
the 'Filter' button and then the 'View more' button.  Add any columns you need, and at the end select the CodeSet
you want to use from the list.

Click 'fetch data' to see the results.

You will see your 'translated' table with the CodeSet data shown.


You can use CodeSets with all types of {{activity}} record - {{referral}}s and so on, as well as {{work}}.

We recommend that you use this as you are creating your CodeSet, and regularly re-run the {{report}} to check your
progress.  

As usual tables can be downloaded.  Do be careful if you open downloads in Excel, however.  Excel will change your data,
for example by changing dates from the text format you've specified to and Excel date, or by removing leading '0's from 
numbers which can break codings.  If you do need to view your downloaded data, a text editor (like Notepad) won't
create these problems.

If you need to run this {{report}} regularly, we recommend you create a template to speed things up and maintain consistency.
