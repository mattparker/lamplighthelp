# 3.3.0    {{Work}}

> {{Lamplight}} stores details of the {{work}} you do (services you provide) as {{work}} records. 

{{Lamplight}} holds details of the {{work}} you do with your {{user}}s. These are called {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}. Each {{work}} record stores information about:

  * when and where it happened;
  * what happened; and
  * who was there.

Each {{work}} record is categorised by '{{workarea}}'. {{Workarea}}s in {{Lamplight}} are a way of categorising the different things that you do, to make it easier to sort, search and report on your {{work}} later. Each {{workarea}} can have {{subworkarea}}s below it.

See section [9.0.0  {{Work}} records](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.0.0) for more about {{work}} records, and section [18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.1) or more information about setting up {{workarea}}s.
