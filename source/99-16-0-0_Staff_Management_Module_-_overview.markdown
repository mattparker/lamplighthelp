# 16.0.0    {{Staff}} Management Module - overview

> The {{Staff}} Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information for {{staff}} and volunteers. 

The {{Staff}} Management Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information, generate and report on timesheets based on existing data, track {{staff}} development. The module also has the capability to restrict access, so that only those with permission can view colleagues profiles. This is achieved by specifying the management responsibility link. This can be altered over time should the organisation hierarchy change.

The module appears within a {{staff}} members profile. It is shown as a series of tabs, labelled:

  * Timesheet - showing hours worked, absence, and non contact time, compared to expected hours
  * Contract Details - showing current and past contracts held with your organisation
  * Non Contact - non service delivery work
  * Absence - sickness or annual leave, including an annual leave calculator
  * Training log
  * Appraisal record

The timesheet information is created automatically due to the information gathered from the other five module tabs.
