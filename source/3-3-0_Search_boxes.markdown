# 3.3.0 Search Boxes

> When adding details of {{people}} to records, {{Lamplight}} uses search-as- you-type. Click on the name when you see the {{person}} you need to add



Search boxes appear in a number of different places in {{Lamplight}}:

- {{Work}} and other {{activity}} records.
- When creating a merge {{group}}.
- When finding profiles to delete in system administration.

Wherever you find one, they all behave in the same way - they search for names as you are typing. You will see a drop-down list of matches appear as you start to type in a name:  

![Search as you type](27a.png)  

{{Lamplight}} will search for names that match what has been typed, as well as those that are similar.

Click on the name you are looking for as soon as it appears, and this will take you to the profile. 

[Section 5.8](/help/index/p/5.8.0) has advanced information about the search boxes.
