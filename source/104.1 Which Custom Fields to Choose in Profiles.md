# 104.1 Which Custom Fields to Choose in Profiles

**It is important to think about what type of field you need - if it is just for qualitative information, or whether it is something that you will need to use for reporting in the future**

The choice of fields that can be added is the same wherever you are putting them. When deciding on which field to choose, think carefully about not only what information you would like to capture, but also how you will need to report on it. You can run a {{report}} using the information in a drop-down list, for example, but while a free-text field is good for storing qualitative information, you will not be able to use it in {{report}}s or {{group}}s.

**Reporting on Custom Fields**
There are several different ways in which custom fields in profiles can be used for reporting. Depending on the type of field that you choose you will be able to:

- Use it for presenting {{report}}s: this allows you to show columns in a {{report}} using this field. If you have a demographic field, for example gender, you could run a report on the number of {{work}} sessions you've had in the last six months, and then choose to present it by your 'Gender' field. This would then give you a column or row for each of the options in that field so that you could see the results for each different group at a glance. (For more on this see [36.3 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/36.3).)
- Filtering {{report}}s: Not all custom fields are available to use to filter when running a report, please see the table below for more information
- For creating {{group}}s: again, using the above field example you can create an auto {{group}} with gender as a filter. (For more on this see [28.5 Auto {{Group}}s: {{Work}}, {{Referral}} and {{Grant}} Fields](/help/index/p/28.5)).
- Add as a column or filter records in a table: you can view tables of records from the main menu (to find out more please see [25 Activity Records Viewing, Filtering and Downloading in Tables](/help/index/p/25)). In this example, you could use the search bar above the table to add in a column for each of the options.

The table below gives details for each type of field.

5. Linked fields

Linked fields are useful for saving information that you will view through the profile. You will not be able to use them in {{report}}s, {{group}}s or {{group}} data views.

Most of the time your fields will have a single value that doesn't change (unless you enter an incorrect value by mistake). For example, a person only has one date of birth, and this will never change. In some other cases you may need to be able to enter multiple records under a specific field. For example, you may need to be able to enter multiple text entries describing medical conditions as a person's medical condition changes. You may also need to be able to {{group}} a set of records together - in this example you may need a 'date diagnosed' field, a 'description of condition' field, and a medication 'field', all linked together.
