Welcome to {{Work}} records, video 2 of 4: Custom Tabs and Fields in {{Work}} Records.

A {{work}} record is a common place to have custom fields. In our system, we have two drop-down lists, and a small text box. You may have other fields here, or in another tab. If you have questions about using different types of field, see video 2.3: custom tabs and fields in profiles.

The first three tabs are the basis of every {{work}} record, and at this point, you would often save and be finished. But as {{work}} records are templates for any type of work you do, you may sometimes need to use custom fields to enter more information.

We’ll save this {{work}} record by clicking ‘Save’ in the bottom-right-hand corner. It’s now shown in the table in the ‘{{Work}} records’ tab. We’ll look at how this table works in a moment, but first, we’ll create one more {{work}} record, which makes use of custom fields.

#### Additional Tabs

I’ll navigate to a {{volunteer}} profile using the search bar, and go to their ‘{{Work}} records’ tab. I’m going to create a {{work}} record for a {{volunteer}} support session we had earlier today, by clicking the ‘Add’ button.

I’ll complete the first three tabs, as I would with any {{work}} record.

I’ll enter the time and date, choose the appropriate {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}}, and complete any other fields needed, such as location, before clicking ‘Next’.

In the ‘Attendance’ tab, I’ll make sure Gwen and I are there, with the correct roles, and complete any custom columns in the attendance table. When I’ve done this, I’ll go to the details tab.

Here I write a summary (a brief heading for the diary), and any other fields I need. I’m going to enter brief notes about the session.

### ‘Volunteer Support’ Tab.

Now, I go to my custom tab, called ‘Volunteer support’.

This tab and its fields are unique to our system, but you may have custom tabs and fields in {{work}} records in yours.

It consists of a series of check-boxes with which to record the topics we covered. I’ll use this tab for entering details of a volunteer support session, and simply ignore it when recording a different type of work.

I’ll complete the tab, and once I’ve finished, I’ll click ‘Save’.

#### Module Tabs

You may also have a variety of tabs relating to modules in your system, such as ‘Media’, ‘Expenses’ or ‘Charging’, and you may also have a ‘Tasks’ tab. We’ll cover each of these separately.

Take a moment to look at your system, identify any custom tabs and fields, and consider for which types of work you’ll use each.
In our next video I’ll introduce recurring {{work}} records. Thanks for watching!
