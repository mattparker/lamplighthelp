# 25.3.0 Library Module: Viewing Items

> All database operators can view the items that have been saved to the library



To view library items:

- Go to 'admin -> library'. 
- A list of all the library items will be shown, organised by category.

To organise them differently, or search for a specific item:

- Click on the 'Search' bar above the first item.

Here you can choose to group your items by:
   - category.
   - tag.
   - date.
   - person who added them.

You can also choose to 'expand all' the or 'collapse all'. If you collapse them, only the group header will be visible until you click the cross to the right of the name.

If you click on the cross, the list of individual entries becomes visible.

You can use the 'search' box to search using a specific term. First, ensure all groups are open by clicking 'expand all', then start to type your search word. Only the groups that have an item matching your search criteria will remain open.
