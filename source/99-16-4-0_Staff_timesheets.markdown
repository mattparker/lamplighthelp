The timesheet is created based on the information recorded from the Contract details, Non contract, Absence, Training, Appraisals and {{Work}} records tabs.

The table highlights how a {{staff}} members time has been distributed over a week and calculates this against their contracted hours. 

The final row of information on the table calculates the total of each column. This table can be downloaded into a spreadsheet format if required, click the 'Download data' link found on the bottom left hand corner of the table if you wish to do so.
