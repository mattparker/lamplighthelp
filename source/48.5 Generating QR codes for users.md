# 48.5 Generating QR codes for users

Your service users can sign in using a QR code: you generate it using {{comm}}s and a special mail merge code.

A QR code is just a way of representing some text. Often it's a URL, but it can be any string of text.
{{Lamplight}} lets you generate QR codes for profiles in your system that you can use to produce sign-in cards, or email
so that people can wave their phone at the sign-in scanner.

To produce QR codes, you need to create a {{comm}} for the people who need one. Follow the instructions
in [section 17](/help/index/p/17) and in the content, use the merge tag <code>{{qr_code}}</code> and {{Lamplight}} will
substitute the QR code image. If you have the {{comm}}s module you can [set up a text template](/help/index/p/21.1.2)
to save time, or [create a Word file Template](/help/index/p/21.1.3). If you do this, the merge tag is <code>${qr_code}</code>.
We definitely recommend doing this.

If you want a smaller QR code, use <code>{{qr_code_sm}}</code>, or for an extra large one use <code>{{qr_code_lg}}</code>.

In this way you can generate QR codes for you services users in Word documents to produce membership cards, or email them direct.
