# 20.6.1 Charge Module: Viewing Payments Due

> When you want to see all charges allocated to a particular {{person}} or {{org}}, they are listed in the charge tab of the profile



To see the charges for a {{person}} or {{org}}:

- Go to their profile.
- Open the 'Charges' tab: this lists all charges allocated to that {{person}} or {{org}}. (If you can't see the tab it is probably hidden in your personal settings - see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2) for instructions on how to unhide the tab.)
- The amounts shown here are ones that the payee policies used have determined, for which the {{person}} should be (or has been) invoiced. 
They are not necessarily the total charge incurred from their attendance at a {{work}} record - another {{person}} or {{org}} may be responsible for part of this.
   - If you do want to see the details, right click on the relevant line of the table and choose 'View Charge Calculations'. This will show you the total amount that was charged, and who else is paying towards it.

   - You can also view the {{work}} record and the invoice (if an invoice has been created) from this same menu (see section [20.6.2 Creating Invoices](/help/index/p/20.6.2) for more information).
