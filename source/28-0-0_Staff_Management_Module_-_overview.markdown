# 28.0.0    {{Staff}} Management Module

> The {{Staff}} Management Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information for {{staff}} and volunteers. 

The {{Staff}} Management Module enables you to capture detailed personnel information, generate and report on timesheets based on existing data, and track {{staff}} development. Using a {{staff}} hierarchy, only those with permission can view colleagues' profiles. The hierarchy can be altered over time when roles and staffing change.

The module appears within a {{staff}} member's profile. It is shown as a series of tabs, labelled:

  * Timesheet - showing hours worked, absence, and non contact time, compared to expected hours
  * Contract Details - showing current and past contracts held with your organisation
  * Non Contact - non service delivery work
  * Absence - sickness or annual leave, including an annual leave calculator
  * Training log
  * Appraisal record

The timesheet information is created automatically using information gathered {{work}} and non-contact records.
