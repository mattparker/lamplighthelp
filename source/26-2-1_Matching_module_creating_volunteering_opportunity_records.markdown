# 26.2.1 Matching Module: Creating {{volunteering opportunity}} records

> A {{Volunteering opportunity}} is the task or role that {{people}} may apply for. Create them on the main menu or in a profile

A {{volunteering opportunity}} is similar to other {{activity}} records.  To create a new one either go to the {{opportunity provider}} profile and the {{volunteering opportunity}} tab, or on the main menu {{activity}} > add new > {{volunteering opportunity}}. 

### When and where

The when and where tab is very similar to that for [{{work}} records](/help/index/p/7.1.1).  The differences are 
 
 - Depending on your context you may not want to use location.  Generally speaking the location will be specified separately in the details tab, and it is that location that's used to geographically match {{volunteering applicant}} to the {{volunteering opportunity}}.
 - The {{volunteering opportunity}} should identify what it is - again depending on your context it may be a job title, volunteering role, or something else.  If you publish {{volunteering opportunity}} records to your website it could be public.
 - Whether to publish the {{volunteering opportunity}} to external websites.  See [section 26.5 Publishing records to a website](/help/index/p/26.5).
 
### {{Opportunity provider}} and {{volunteer}}s

You need to specify the {{opportunity provider}} profile initially.  You can also then add any {{volunteer}} profiles that are fulfilling this {{volunteering opportunity}}.  This may well be empty initially, but as you match {{volunteering application}} records the attendance table will grow.

Search for profiles by starting to type their name in the search boxes, and select the correct one as you see it in the dropdown list.

### Opportunity details

There are three aspects of a {{volunteering opportunity}} that are used to match to {{volunteering application}} records: where; when; and what.  You can choose to match on all three of these, or just one, so you don't have to use all sections if they are not appropriate to your context.

#### {{Volunteering opportunity}} location

If the {{volunteering opportunity}} happens at the main address of the {{opportunity provider}} you should tick the box 'Use address of provider'.  You will need to check that the profile address is correct and up-to-date - {{Lamplight}} uses the postcode to match to {{volunteering application}} records.

If it happens elsewhere you can specify the address instead, and this is the one that will be used to match.

#### {{Volunteering opportunity}} availability

Use this section to specify when during the week, and between which dates, the {{volunteering opportunity}} is available.
