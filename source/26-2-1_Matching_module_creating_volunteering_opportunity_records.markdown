# 26.2.1 Matching Module: Creating {{volunteering_opportunity}} records

> A {{Volunteering_opportunity}} is the task or role that {{people}} may apply for. Create them on the main menu or in a profile

A {{volunteering_opportunity}} is similar to other {{activity}} records.  To create a new one either go to the {{opportunity_provider}} profile and the {{volunteering_opportunity}} tab, or on the main menu {{activity}} > add new > {{volunteering_opportunity}}. 

#### When and where

The when and where tab is very similar to that for [{{work}} records](/help/index/p/7.1.1).  The differences are 
 
 - Depending on your context you may not want to use location.  Generally speaking the location will be specified separately in the details tab, and it is that location that's used to geographically match {{volunteering_applicant}} to the {{volunteering_opportunity}}.
 - The {{volunteering_opportunity}} should identify what it is - again depending on your context it may be a job title, volunteering role, or something else.  If you publish {{volunteering_opportunity}} records to your website it could be public.
 - Whether to publish the {{volunteering_opportunity}} to external websites.
