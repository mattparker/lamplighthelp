# 26.2.1 Matching Module: Creating {{Volunteering Opportunity}} Records

> A {{volunteering opportunity}} is the task or role that {{people}} may apply for. You create them from the main menu or directly in a profile

A {{volunteering opportunity}} is similar to other {{activity}} records. To create a new one either go to the
{{volunteering opportunity}} tab in the {{opportunity provider}}'s profile, or choose {{activity}} > add new >
{{volunteering opportunity}} from the main menu.

### When and Where

The 'When and where' tab is very similar to that for [{{work}} records](/help/index/p/7.1.1). The differences are:

- You may not want to use location here as it will be entered separately in the 'Details' tab. {{Lamplight}} uses the
  information in the 'Details' tab to make a geographical match of the {{volunteering applicant}} to the {{volunteering
  opportunity}}.
- The {{volunteering opportunity}} should identify what it is. This could be a job title, volunteering role, or
  something else. If you publish {{volunteering opportunity}} records to your website the information you enter here
  will be public.
- Whether to publish the {{volunteering opportunity}} to external websites.
  See [section 26.5 Publishing records to a website](/help/index/p/26.5).

### {{Opportunity Provider}} and {{Volunteer}}s

You need to specify who the {{opportunity provider}} is initially. If you have any {{volunteer}}s who are fulfilling
this {{volunteering opportunity}} you can also add them at this stage. This may well be empty at first, but as you pair
up {{volunteering application}}s the attendance table will grow.

As for attendance tables in other types of {{activity}} record, you can search for profiles by starting to type their
name in the search boxes, then selecting the one you want when it appears in the dropdown list.

### Opportunity Details

There are three details of each {{volunteering opportunity}} that are used to match them with {{volunteering
application}}s: 'where', 'when', and 'what'. You can choose to match on all three of these, or just one (this means that
you don't have to use all sections if they don't apply to your opportunity).

#### {{Volunteering Opportunity}} Location

If the {{volunteering opportunity}} will take place at the main address of the {{opportunity provider}}, you should tick
the box 'Use address of provider'. You will need to check that the address in the profile of the {{opportunity
provider}} is correct and up-to-date as {{Lamplight}} will use this postcode to match to {{volunteering application}}s.

If it happens at an alternative address, untick the 'address of provider' box and enter the details in the boxes below.
This will then be used by {{Lamplight}} to make matches.

#### {{Volunteering Opportunity}} Availability

Use this section to show when the {{volunteering opportunity}} is available. This includes specifying which days, and
also between which dates.

#### What the {{Volunteering Opportunity}} Is

The rest of the 'Opportunity details' section is used to give more detail of the {{volunteering opportunity}}. This
includes text boxes for description, requirements and practical considerations, where you can enter additional
inforamtion for potential applicants. Below this the checkboxes for categories can be used to match to your
{{volunteering application}}s.

Any of the information in this tab may appear on a public website if you are publishing {{volunteering opportunity}}
records.
