# 16.6.0    System Administration - Lists

> Managing drop-down lists in system administration allows you to add, edit and delete {{work area}}s, {{outcomes}}, {{case}} categories, relationship types and {{referral}} success categories



There are a number of drop-down lists which exist in {{Lamplight}}. These can all be added and edited in the same way. They do not always save well when edited in the Chrome browser (due to a bug in the browser itself), so we recommend using Edge or Firefox. 

### Important Things to Consider when Making Changes 

When you make changes to a drop-down list, it can have an effect on your existing data.  It’s very important to consider this before you start.

- If you delete an item from a list, this will remove the item from the existing list and you will not be able to see where this was previously selected. For example, if you delete the 'parent/child' relationship, this will no longer show in the profile of anyone who was previously recorded as having it.
- Changing the name can also affect your data.  If for example you rename the attendance type option ‘Cancelled’ to ‘Booked’, everyone previously listed as ‘Cancelled’ will now show as 'Booked'.  This would affect your reporting, and your view of completed activities.

### To Find the Relevant List
- Go to 'admin -> system admin -> Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down Lists'.
- Click on the list you would like to alter.

### To Edit Existing Items:
- Find the list that you item is in, and the relevant item in the list. 
- Hover your mouse over the text you want to edit and double-click.

- Make your changes, and press the 'enter' key to save them.

### To Re-order Items Already in the List:
- Find the item that you want to move in the list. 
- Left click on it and hold down the mouse button. 
- Move the box to its new position.
- Release the mouse button. Other items in the list will move out of the way as you move the item up or down. 
- The new order will be saved when you release the mouse button.

### To Add New Items to a List:
- At the bottom of the list, double-click the box which says 'double-click to add'.
- In the box which opens, type in the name of the item you want to add.
- Click 'enter' on the keyboard to save. 
- Continue this process until all the options you need have been added. 

### To Delete an Item:
- Find the item you would like to delete in the list.
- Drag it to the grey 'Drag here to delete' box at the bottom. 
- Drop it on top of the box.
