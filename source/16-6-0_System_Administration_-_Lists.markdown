# 16.6.0    System Administration - Lists

> Managing drop-down lists in system administration allows you to add, edit and delete {{work area}}s, {{outcomes}}, {{case}} categories, relationship types and {{referral}} success categories

There are a number of drop-down lists which exist in {{Lamplight}}. These can all be added and edited in the same way. They do not always save well when edited in the Chrome browser (due to a bug in the browser itself), so we recommend using Edge or Firefox. 

### Important Things to Consider when Making Changes 

When you make changes to a drop-down list, it can have an effect on your existing data.  It’s very important to consider this before you start.

- If you delete an item from a list, this will remove the item from the existing list and you will not be able to see where this was previously selected. For examples, anyone who had a ‘parent/child relationship’, will no longer have that relationship if you delete the option.
- Changing the name can also affect your data.  If for example you change the attendance type option ‘Cancelled’, to ‘Booked’, then everyone previously listed as ‘Cancelled’ will now show as 'Booked'.  This would affect your reporting, and your view of completed activities.


**To find the relevant list:**
- Click admin on the main menu, then choose system administration.
- Under the Manage drop-down list section, click on the list you would like to alter.

**To edit existing items:**

- Mover your mouse over the text you want to edit and double-click:

- make your changes, and press the 'enter' key to save them.

**To re-order items already in the list:**

- drag the box by clicking on the box and holding the mouse button
- move it to the new position
- release the mouse button. Other items in the list will move out of the way as you move the item up or down. 
- the new order will be saved when you release the mouse button.

- Click 'enter' on the keyboard to save.
