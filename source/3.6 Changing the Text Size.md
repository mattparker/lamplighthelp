# 3.6 Changing the Text Size


Lamplight adapts to the size of the screen you&#039;re using, so it can work on your phone as well as a bigger desktop monitor.

It may be helpful to zoom in and out. You can fit in a lot more information on the screen by zooming out, or focus on details by zooming in.

### To zoom in or out:

Hold down Ctrl key on your keyboard

Move your mouse scroll wheel forwards (to zoom in) or backwards (to zoom out). If you don't have a scroll whell you can press + or - keys on your keyboard while still holding down CTRL.

To reset the zoom, press Ctrl and 0.

Here&#039;s Lamplight zoomed in to 400%
