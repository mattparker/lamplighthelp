# 3.6 Changing the Text Size


Lamplight adapts to the size of the screen you&#039;re using, so it {{work}}s on your phone and on your gigantic desktop monitor.
You can zoom web pages in and out. Sometimes you need to fit lots of information all on one screen; other times you need it bigger.
To zoom in or out:
Hold down Ctrl key
Wheel the mouse wheel OR press + or - keys
To reset, press Ctrl and 0.

Here&#039;s Lamplight zoomed in to 400%
