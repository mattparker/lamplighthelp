# 103.2.2 Home page Tab – Other Widgets

Below the diary widget on the left of the screen in the Home page tab are other options for information you can add to the home screen
1. The ‘My {{user}}s’ option adds {{user}}s allocated to you with the &#039;My user&#039; or primary {{staff}}/{{user}} relationship

1a In ‘More settings…’ for the &#039;My {{user}}&#039; widget, you can add a {{Group}} dataview to customise the columns you see in the {{user}} table

2. The ‘Recently viewed profiles’ widget {{group}}s of the last ten profiles viewed
3. The ‘My {{Message}}s’ widget shows a table of {{message}}s assigned to you
4. The ‘{{Safeguarding}} and {{safeguarding dbscheck}}s’ widget {{group}}s new {{safeguarding}} {{linked case}}s and DBS checks expiring soon
5. The ‘Impact tools’ widget gives quick links to add {{outcome}} and {{eval}} data for profiles
It looks like this on the home page (the {{outcome}}s, {{eval}}s and profile details you see will be specific to your system):

When on the home page, you can select the profile and type of record you want to add from here
6. The ‘Daily register’ gives a {{group}} of profiles attending {{activity}} records for today. It looks like this on the home page:

7. The ‘News from Lamplight‘ widget gives a place where you can view system updates, training and other updates from Lamplight

8. The ‘Report template’ widget displays the results of a {{report}} on your home page
Once you have added the {{report}}, and chosen &#039;More settings...&#039;, you&#039;ll have the option to choose any of the {{report}} templates currently set-up in your system.
We recommend you do not have this widget open by default. Choosing a {{report}} template will load that {{report}} afresh each time you load the home page, and more complex {{report}}s processing large amounts of data will take longer to load. This is likely to have an impact on your home page loading speed.

This is what it looks like on the home page:

9. Choose the ‘{{Group}} and View’ widget to display a {{group}} and dataview on your Home page
This widget uses a {{group}} and dataview template (a {{group}} and dataview set-up to always run together).
As with {{report}}s, we recommend you do not have this widget open by default as a large or more complex {{group}} and data view will take longer to load when you visit the Home page.
9a. Select which template to use in the &#039;More settings&#039; section
