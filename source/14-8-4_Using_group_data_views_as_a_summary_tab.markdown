# 14.8.4    Using {{group}} data views as a summary tab and around Lamplight

> You can add a summary tab to profiles which will bring information from the different tabs into one. Use a {{group}} data view to create a summary tab. 

You can add a summary tab to profiles which will bring information from the different tabs into one. This is fully customisable; each system operator can set up a different summary tab, and the summary tab uses a {{group}} data view to know what information to display. You can change or remove this at any time.

To add a summary tab:

  * Create a {{group}} data view with the information you want on the summary tab (see section [14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.1)) 
  * Go to {{Group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> view, on the main menu
  * Right-click or use the menu button, on the {{group}} data view you want to use. Click on 'use in summary tab in profiles' on the popup window. You will receive a confirmation message that the setting has changed.
  * View a profile for someone. You'll see a new 'summary' tab displayed as the first tab.

To change the {{group}} data view you use, just repeat this with the relevant {{group}} data view. To remove the summary tab completely, click 'remove summary tab' on the summary tab itself within a profile. 


Some tables around Lamplight can also be customisable and set as a unique setting for each database operator. 

To add custom table columns:

  * Create a {{group}} data view with the information you want on the table (see section [14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.1)) 
  * Go to admin -> system administration -> change my personal settings, on the main menu
  * Scroll down to the 'profiles' section 
  * Select the {{group}} data views you want to use as 1) summary tab, 2) heading strip on profiles, 3) columns on the relationships tab
