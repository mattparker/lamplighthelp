# 16.7.5 Adding Custom Columns to the Attendance Table

> You can add custom columns to the attendance table you see in {{work}} records

CHECK CAREFULLY - NEEDS WORK ON TYPES OF FIELD AND REPORTING

The other option you'll see in '{{Work}} record custom tabs and fields' is 'view and edit custom columns on the attendance table'.  

If you look at the Attendance tab in a {{Work}} record you will see the attendance table. There are a number of columns, including name, attendance type, and role.  It's possible to add additional custom columns here (you may already have some.)

**Adding a new column**

To create a new tab, select the button 'Click here to add' in the left-hand 'Current Sets' column. This will bring up a new 'set' in the middle column. Click on the text 'click to add' (this will be on the second line down, not the title). This opens up a pop-up box where you can name the column (the top 'Text' box) and select from various options:. 


- Restrict this field to managers/admins?: Although you can tick this field, it does not function in this record.
- Projects: You can select which projects this field should display for (if you have more than one project). 
- You may also see fields about publishing, if you have the publishing module. See section 24.0 Publishing Module. 
- Click 'Save' to save the tab.

**Important** You must always add a field to a tab, to ensure it remains editable and visible in System Administration. If you do not, you'll have an empty tab in your record which you will be unable to edit. In this case, please contact Lamplight for support.

**Adding a field**

In the middle column, choose the button 'Click to add'. A new section will now appear in the right-hand column: 'Column: Click to add.' Double click on the non-bold text 'Column name: Click to add' and a pop--up box will open. Again, some of the options show here are redundant for the attendance table. (For types of custom field in {{activity}} records see XXXXXXXXX).


- Text: This is the name of the field.
- What type of person is this for: No answer can be selected here, as records show all fields for all users.
- Type: This selects the type of field you will be creating. By default, a new field will be a 'select' field, unless changed. For types of field see XXXXXXX. Reporting is more limited on custom attendance table fields than for normal fields in a work record.  You can use them to present your report (as either row or column data) in {{work} reports, and display them in a person's {{work}} records profile tab, but they can't be used in groups, and only in Dataviews using a custom template. XXXXX types of field will not work with attendance table columns (even though it is still possible to select them.)
- Is this a required field: If this is selected, a user will not be able to exit the tab without entering information. Use very cautiously.
- Restrict this field to managers/admins?: Although you can tick this field, it does not function in this record.
- Projects: You can select which projects (If you have more than one project) this field should display for.
- You may also see fields about publishing, if you have the publishing module. (See: XXXXXXX) 
- Click save once you have completed the appropriate fields.

**Editing a column**

To edit a column, select the set in the left-hand column, and when the information shows in the middle column, double click on the text 'Set label', and edit the existing information (as above)

**Editing a field**

Choose the field you wish to edit in the centre column, and click on it. In the right-hand column, you will see the field information appear (you may need to scroll up if you have a long list of options.) Double click on the non-bold text, where it says 'Column name:'. From here follow the process as above to edit and save the field.

**Things to consider**
- The attendance table can become quickly crowded if you add too many columns, and so consider what you need carefully.
- Keep your column name short, as this is what will appear in the header row of the attendance table.
