All changes to the {{safeguarding case}} are logged within it, and appear in a timeline below the main description of the {{safeguarding case}}. The
earliest actions are shown first. This gives you a full history of te investigation at a glance, and provides an audit
trail should it be required.

The timeline is shown below the main {{safeguarding case}} details and actions. The earliest actions are shown first.

It’s important to understand that you don’t edit records in the usual sense. Any changes are actions, and Notes cannot
be amended, only commented on. 

Within the timeline there are two types of entry. System entries show actions carried out (e.g. changes in status) - they
show the process of the {{safeguarding case}}.  User entries are Comments and Notes - the substantive information about  
the {{safeguarding case}}. You can show or hide system entries in the timeline by clicking the 'toggle messages' button.
