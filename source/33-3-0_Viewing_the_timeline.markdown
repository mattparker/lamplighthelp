# 33.3.0 View the timeline of a {{safeguarding case}}

> {{Safeguarding case}}s have a timeline of the actions carried out on that {{safeguarding case}}. They are shown below the main actions panel.

All changes to the {{safeguarding case}} are logged within it, and appear in a timeline below the main description of the {{safeguarding case}}. The
earliest actions are shown first. This gives you a full history of te investigation at a glance, and provides an audit
trail should it be required.


It’s important to understand that you don’t edit records in the usual sense. Any changes are actions, and Notes cannot
be amended, only commented on. 

Within the timeline there are two types of entry. System entries show actions carried out (e.g. changes in status) - they
show the process of the {{safeguarding case}}.  User entries are Comments and Notes - the substantive information about  
the {{safeguarding case}}. You can show or hide system entries in the timeline by clicking the 'toggle messages' button.

You can show or hide these using the 'Toggle comments' button that appears in the 'Utilities'  section of the actions:

Whether these comments are visible when you first view a {{safeguarding case}} depends on the global settings in your system.
A system administrator can set this, depending on your requirements.
