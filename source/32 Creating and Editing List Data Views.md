![32 Creating and Editing {{Group}} Data Views - step 3](32_Creating_and_Editing_List_Data_Views_im_3.png)

4. The first screen is where you&#039;ll need to give the data view a name and a description.
When you view the table of data views in the future the name is what you will see, so try and choose something that will remind you and other profile what it&#039;s for

5. Contact details
You can select which contact information you&#039;d like to see. Please note, if you use this data view with a {{group}}, the {{person}}/{{org}}&#039;s name will already appear by default so you won&#039;t need to include it here.

6. Relationships
You can show information in your data view about named individuals/{{org}}s that profiles of the {{group}} are linked to.
Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see the &#039;name only&#039; of the linked profile, or &#039;name and contact details&#039;.
If you select &#039;name and contact details for download&#039; you will get the same information as &#039;name and contact details&#039; but each field is separated by a pipe symbol - | - and empty fields are included.
This means that if you download the data and do &#039;text to columns&#039; you&#039;ll be able to get the data nicely. However it doesn&#039;t look so nice on screen if you just want to see the information in Lamplight.

7. {{User}} fields, {{Volunteer}} fields and {{Staff}} fields
The information in these tabs relates to the custom fields in the profile tabs of your profiles/{{org}}s. The options within these pages will be unique to your system.

8. Detailed summary figures
The &#039;Detailed summary figures&#039; section allows you to be more specific about the information you see in your data view. You will need to fill in the &#039;Detailed {{work}} data&#039; to show what information you want about the records, as well as the date range of the data you want to see. There are other filters, such as {{work}} area and location, which you can use to filter the records shown.
