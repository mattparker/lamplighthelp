# 31.0.1 Overview of the steps to create a {{recruiter}} campaign

> A Question Set is a series of questions that are answered by {{recruiter_applicant}}s.

You can create multiple Question Sets in your system, for different types of role.  Question Sets
can be re-used in multiple campaigns, so you will probably need a Question Set for each role.

We recommend that most questions are open, text questions.  They should relate closely to the 
capabilities you've identified in the job description and ideally reflect the sorts of tasks 
that the job involves.

To create a Question Set, go to 'admin > system admin > {{Recruiter}} module > Manage {{recruiter}} question sets'.

You create Question Sets in the same way that you add custom tabs and fields for profiles - 
full instructions are given [in section 16.7.0](/en/help/p/16.7.0).

## Quick start

1. Click 'add new question set' button. Enter a title for the Questions - probably the role name.
2. Click 'add new question'.  Enter the question text, and select the question type. Click update.
3. Continue adding questions.
4. Click 'save all changes' at the top (or bottom) of the screen.

Note that if you add any text to the 'Description' or 'Placeholder' fields, they will be visible
to {{recruiter_applicant}}s.

## Adding Mark Schemes

A Mark Scheme is a set of notes for shortlisting panel members, to help them agree what you're looking
for in responses.

To create or edit a Mark Scheme for a saved Question Set, click the 'Set the Mark Scheme for these questions'.
Make sure you've saved any changes to your questions first.
