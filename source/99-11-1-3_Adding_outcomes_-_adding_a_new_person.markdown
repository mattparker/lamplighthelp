# 11.1.3    Adding {{outcome}}s - adding a new {{person}}

> If the {{person}} is not already on {{Lamplight}}, you can add them now. 

You can add an {{outcome}} for someone who is not already on the database. Type in their name in the search box, and if they do not show up on the drop- down menu click the 'Add to list' button on the right. A popup window will appear asking you to confirm their details:

![Adding a new {{person}} while adding {{outcome}} details]({{imgpath}}77a.png)

Click the 'save' button when you have checked the information.

{{Lamplight}} will double-check whether this {{person}} is already on the system, and tries to check for spelling differences. If there are any {{people}} already on the system who have similar names, they will be shown in another popup window:

![Adding a new {{person}} - duplicates]({{imgpath}}77b.png)

If you want to use one of these existing {{people}}, click the row of the table in the popup window, and they will be added to the main attendance list. If you are certain that they are not already on the system, click the 'click here' button and they will be added to the main attendance list. A profile will also be created for them, which you will need to go and add any other information to that you know once you have finished the {{outcome}} record.
