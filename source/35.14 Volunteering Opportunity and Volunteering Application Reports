# 35.14 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i>  {{Volunteering Opportunity}} and {{Volunteering Application}} {{Report}}s

> You can create {{report}}s from information entered in the {{Matching}} Module. This will show you the numbers of 
{{volunteering opportunity}} records, the number of {{volunteering application}} records and how many have been matched.

*** UP TO HERE ***

To run a {{report}} for the {{Matching}} Module:

1. Go to {{Report}}s
![35.14 {{Volunteering Opportunity}} and {{Volunteering Application}} {{Report}}s - step 1](35.14_Volunteering_Opportunity_and_Volunteering_Application_Reports_im_1.png)

2. At the top of the page you will see all the different types of {{report}} listed. For the {{Matching}} Module there are two options:
  - {{volunteering opportunity}} {{report}}
  - {{volunteering application}} {{report}}
![35.14 {{Volunteering Opportunity}} and {{Volunteering Application}} {{Report}}s - step 2](35.14_Volunteering_Opportunity_and_Volunteering_Application_Reports_im_2.png)

To run a {{volunteering opportunity report}}:

1. Select '{{volunteering opportunity}} {{report}}'
![35.14 {{Volunteering Opportunity}} and {{Volunteering Application}} {{Report}}s - step 3](35.14_Volunteering_Opportunity_and_Volunteering_Application_Reports_im_3.png)

2. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    - view an existing {{report}} template (if there are templates set up in your system)
    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{volunteering opportunity}} {{report}} using your own criteria'

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 

7. These filters are the same as for other {{report}}s (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1))

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

8. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data (for more on the different options see [36.3 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/36.3))

9. The options for 'Data to show' are specific to the {{Matching}} Module and are,

  - 'All summary data (will ignore column selection above)'
  - 'Number of opportunities'
  - 'Number of providers'
  - 'Open opportunities'
  - 'Number of applications'
  - 'Number of applicants'

10. Click 'run {{report}}'

11. NEED TO PUT RECORD IN (PENDING QN) TO SEE WHAT REOPRT LOOKS LIKE

***UP TO HERE*** GET PICS IN AND FINISH STEPS ABOVE AND BELOW (PENDING QNS)

The {{volunteering opportunity}} {{report}} will give you a table similar to this:

![{{Volunteering opportunity}} sample {{report}}](15.3a.png)

A single {{opportunity provider}} may have several {{volunteering opportunity}} records; this is the difference between the first two data columns.  Similarly, one {{volunteering applicant}} may have many {{volunteering application}} records: this explains the difference between the last two columns.

The {{volunteering application}} {{report}} will give a table similar to this:

![{{Volunteering application}} sample {{report}}](15.3b.png)

It gives similar data but from the side of {{volunteering application}} records.


You can create [{{report}} templates (sect 14.1.6)](/help/index/p/14.1.6) for both of these {{report}}s word if needed.
