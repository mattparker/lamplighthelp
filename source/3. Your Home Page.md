# 3 Your Home Page

The Home Page is the first tab you’ll see when you log in to Lamplight. When you need to go back to the Home Page, you can click Home at the top of the page at any time.

The options you see on your Home Page are set by the template you have on your user account. Your System Admin can make changest to this template if you need them, but you will normally be able to see the most important things for your login. 

A system administrator can change the tabs that appear on your home page in System Administration using Operator Templates - see section [103 Creating and Editing Operator Templates](/help/index/p/103) for more information.
