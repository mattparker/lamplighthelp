# 21.3.1 To Communicate with Everyone Attending a Particular {{Work}} Record

> It is possible to create a mail-merged letter or email for everyone attending a particular {{work}} record

To send one communication to all the attendees of a {{work}} record:

- Find the relevant record (either in the profile of {{work}}->view->work (for more on this see xxxxx and xxxxx).
- Click on the context menu to the left of the record in the table, or right click on the table row.
- On the context menu, choose 'Communicate'.
- This will open up a window for a {{comm}} record. You will need to fill it in as usual (see XXXXXXXXX), but the Recipients table is already filled in with the details of those attending the {{work}} record.
- By opening the {{comm}} record in this way, you can also use details from the {{work}} record as merge fields.
   - In the 'Message content' tab, choose '{{Activity}} merge' on the text editing toolbar. 
   - Select the fields taht you would like to be inserted in the communication - for example, 'start time'. {{Lamplight}} will use the details entered in the {{work}} record to populate these fields for you.
