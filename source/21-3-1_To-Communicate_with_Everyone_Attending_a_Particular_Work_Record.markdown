# 21.3.1 {{Comm}}s Module: Communicating with Everyone Attending a Particular {{Work}} Record

> It is possible to create a mail-merged letter or email for everyone attending a particular {{work}} record

To send one {{comm}} to all the attendees of a {{work}} record:

- Find the relevant record (either in the profile or in {{work}} -> view -> {{work}} (for more on this see [7.2.0 {{Work}} Tab](/help/index/p/7.2.0) and [7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0).
- Click on the context menu to the left of the record in the table, or right click on the table row.
- Choose 'Communicate'from the context menu.
- This will open up a window for a {{comm}} record. You will need to fill it in as usual (see [10.1.0 Creating a {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/10.1.0)) - the recipients table will already be filled in with the details of those attending the {{work}} record.
- By opening the {{comm}} record in this way, you can also use details from the {{work}} record as merge fields.
   - In the 'Message content' tab, choose '{{Activity}} merge' on the text editing toolbar. 
   - Select the fields that you would like to be inserted in the {{comm}}. {{Lamplight}} will use the details entered in the {{work}} record to populate these fields for you.
