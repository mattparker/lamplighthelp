# 29.4.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Timesheets

> {{Staff}} timesheets are created based on the information recorded in the contract details and non-contract, absence, training, appraisal and {{work}} records in the profile 

![{{Staff}} timesheet](123a.png)


- The timesheet table in each {{staff}} profile shows the different ways time has been spent and calculates recorded hours against contracted ones. 
- This information is not added directly to the sheet, but is drawn by {{Lamplight}} from contract details and non-contract, absence, training, appraisal and {{work}} records in their profile.
   - There is a column for each category of time spent (absence, {{work}}, non-contact etc.), and these are added together to give the total time spent for each week. 
   - {{Lamplight}} pulls the contracted hours from information added in the 'Contract details' tab.
   - The 'Difference' column calculates the difference between contracted hours and the total recorded for the week.
   - 'Wage' is based on the amount of contracted hours recorded for the week multiplied by the hourly rate for that worker recorded in the 'Contract details' tab. 
- This table can be downloaded into a spreadsheet if required. To do this, click the 'Download data' link found at the bottom of the table.
- You can also prepare it for print format by clicking the 'Print' button below the table.

There are system administration settings which affect how timesheets are handled, including aggregating {{staff}} time across different {{Lamplight}} projects and deciding which attendance types and roles will be included in the timesheet. For more on this see [29.1.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Set-up](/help/index/p/29.1.0).
