# 16.11.4 Setting Up Office 365 With Two Factor Authentication

> Instructions for setting up email in {{Lamplight}} if you have an Outlook account with two factor authentication activated

### Two Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication means entering a code in addition to your normal email address and password.  This code may be sent to you in a text message, or may be generated by an app on your phone.  You may not need to enter it every time you log in: you can set it to only require the code every 30 days.   

You can find online instructions from Microsoft for setting up two factor authentication at [Microsoft Office Support](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/set-up-2-step-verification-for-office-365-ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14?ui=en-US&rs=en-GB&ad=GB).

### Generating a Password from Office 365

- Go to Outlook or Office 365 online, and log in with your username and password.
- In the very top right of the screen, click on your initials in the small circle to show the menu.
- Choose ‘My account’

- Give the app password a name (such as Lamplight).
- You’ll be shown the password.  Copy it to your clipboard, you won’t see this again.  You will need to enter it in to Lamplight, after which you won't need it again so you can delete it.
- The exact path to follow in Microsoft  may change as they update their help, but is likley to always be in the ‘Security’ area.

### Entering Settings in Lamplight

- From the main menu, go to 'admin -> system administration'.
- Under ‘Communication Settings’ you'll see two options:
   - Email settings: to send via a single email account for all operators. You can use this as a default for all operators if you want to. Once you have set this up, anyone without an individual operator email account will still be able to send emails from this one.
   - Email settings: to send via individual operator email accounts. Use this option to have different settings for individual users.
- Whichever you are setting up, you will need to complete the following fields for each email account you add:

[Lamplight Settings](16.11.1c.png)

Host name: smtp.office365.com.  
Port: 587.  
Authentication: login.  
SSL type: TLS.  
Username: your email address.  
Password: the password you just generated.  

- If you’re setting up individual operators, you may wish to ask them to enter their password directly into the form.  
- Save when complete.  
- Repeat this for each account you need to add.
  
### Email Sending Limits

There are some limits on how many emails you can send with some accounts.  Each type of Office 365 account is different, and we advise you check your account.  
If you need to, you can use MailChimp with Lamplight. See [21.2.0 {{Comm}}s: Linkiing with Mailchimp](/help/index/p/21.2.0) for more details.
