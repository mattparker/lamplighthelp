# 15.1.0 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> {{Comm}}s {{Report}}

> With {{comm}}s {{report}}s you can identify and present the number of {{comm}}s made or logged



You can show all your {{comm}}s over a given time in a {{report}}.

### {{Report}} Filters
- From the main menu select {{report}}s -> {{comm}}s {{report}}. 
- Enter the filter information as required. This is the same as for other {{report}} types (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1) for more information).
- If you use {{workarea}}s when you are sending {{comm}}s then you can filter by this. (It is possible to turn {{Workarea}}s on for your sent {{comm}}s - for more on this see [16.12.5 Global Settings: {{Comm}}s](/help/index/p/16.12.5).
- You can also use the {{workarea}} filter to narrow down your logged {{comm}}s as it is a mandatory field on those records.

### {{Report}} Presentation

The fields in this tab work in the same way as they do for other {{report}}s - see [14.1.4 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/14.1.4).  Under 'Row data' '{{Comm}} type' is selected by default. This means that your {{report}} results will be split to show you types of different kind of {{comm}}.

As with other {{report}}s, you can also choose other fields to present your information by, for example demographic information from the profile as below.

### The {{Report}}

The {{report}} shows you the number of different types of {{comm}} sent in the timescale you have used.
