![43.5 Data Direct Module -  {{Eval}} Settings - step 3](43.5_Data_Direct_Module_-__Evaluation_Settings_im_3.png)

4. Provide a title for your {{campaign}}
For example, you may have a generic &#039;training feedback&#039; {{eval}} template, but the {{campaign}} title could refer to the specific course (e.g. Health and Safety course May 2011). Please note, this title will be seen by your recipients

5. Select the time and date the {{campaign}} starts
This defines when it will be available online for your invitees to complete.

![43.5 Data Direct Module -  {{Eval}} Settings - step 5](43.5_Data_Direct_Module_-__Evaluation_Settings_im_5.png)

6. Select the time and date the {{campaign}} ends
This is the closing time and date, when the web link will no longer {{work}}.

7. Select a {{work}}area
When responses return into Lamplight, you can choose which {{work}} area they&#039;ll be tagged to. This enables you to use the same {{eval}} for different services and supports your later {{report}} filters.

8. Choose if you want to create a separate page for each invitee by ticking/un-ticking the box
This option allows you to decide if it&#039;s anonymous or not. We recommend you give this some thought as to the type of {{eval}} it is and whether it should be connected to the {{person}} or will having it anonymous allow for more honest responses (if it&#039;s a feedback form for example). If you leave this option ticked, Lamplight will create a unique URL (website address) for each invitee. This means that you will be able to see who has responded, and their answers will be recorded/saved in their profile, ie. not anonymous. It&#039;s good practice to ensure invitees know their responses are not anonymous. If you untick this box, all invitees will receive the same link, give anonymous replies, and the information will not be saved in individual profiles.

9. Confirm if you want invitees to be able to use their web link more than once or not
If you send out individual emails (the box above is ticked and the responses are therefore not anonymous) then you can choose whether invitees only have one chance to respond; whether they can send one response, but come back and edit it a later date; or whether they can send in a number of responses at different times. Remember that profiles may share the website address with others. If you do not create separate pages for each invitee, then you cannot control whether the link is used more than once.

12. Search for profiles
If this is NOT an anonymous {{campaign}}, you can add profile names im{{media}}tely. Search for {{people}} by starting to type their name in the &#039;Find profiles&#039; box. Please note, additional profiles can be added to this {{campaign}} at a later date.
If this is an anonymous {{campaign}}, leave this table empty.
