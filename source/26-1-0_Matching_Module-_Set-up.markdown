# 26.1.0 Matching Module: Set-up

> The Matching Module has a series of select options that are used to match. You can change these if need be

#### Categories

The matching module uses five sets of categories for both {{volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}} records.  By default these are:

- **Interests** of the {{volunteering applicant}}.
- who it would be **ideal for** (e.g. any personal circumstances a {{volunteering applicant}} might have).
- **Role** - what they would be doing.
- **Requirements** - any competencies etc. the {{volunteering applicant}} may need.
- **Skills** the {{volunteering applicant}} will gain.

The items in these lists, and the labels for the lists themselves, can be changed in your system as required.

Each list can have two levels - the main categories, and then a series of subcategories within each.  When you are creating a {{volunteering application}} or {{volunteering opportunity}} you can select as many items from each list as you want, from any category:

At the moment you will need to ask us to if you need to change the items in these lists - please contact us if so.

#### Attendance roles

You will also need to create two attendance roles, one for {{volunteering applicant}} attendances and one for {{opportunity provider}}s.  We will need to assign these for you - please contact us if this has not been done.
