# 26.1.0 Matching Module: Set-up

> The Matching Module has a series of select options that are used to match. You can change these if need be

#### Categories

The matching module uses five sets of categories for both {{volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}} records.  By default these are called:

- **Interests** of the {{volunteering applicant}}.
- Would be **ideal for** (e.g. age and any personal circumstances of the {{volunteering applicant}}).
- **Role** - what they would be doing in the {{volunteeering opportunity}}.
- **Requirements** - any experience, qualifications etc. the {{volunteering applicant}} may need.
- **Skills** the {{volunteering applicant}} will gain.

The items in these lists, and the labels for the lists themselves, can be changed in your system as required.

Each list can have two levels - the main categories, and then a series of subcategories within each. When you are creating a {{volunteering application}} or {{volunteering opportunity}} you can select as many items from each list as you want, from any category or subcategory.

### Adding Items to a Category or Subcategory

- Go to 'system admin, then in the 'Module Adminstratation' section find the 'Matching Module' and click on the list that you would like to edit. 
- Each existing category is shown in the list underneath.

### Adding a Single Category

- Above the list of existing categories is a button with the option to 'add new category'. Click on this.

![Adding a New Category](26.1.0a.png)

- In the pop-up box, add the name of the category in the 'Text' box.
- When you have finished, click on 'Update'. 
- If you don't want to add any subcategories at this point, don't forget to click the 'save all changes' button at the top or bottom of the page before you leave, or you will lose this new category.
- If you want to add subcategories, see 'Adding subcategories' below.

### Adding Multiple Categories

You can also bulk add categories to this list in one go. 
- Above the list of existing categoriess, click on the 'bulk add category' button.
- In the pop-up box, type the names of the categories you want to add. Each one should be separated by a semi-colon, but you don't need any spaces between each one. For example 'Administration;Team working;Counselling;Advice work'. 
- Once you have finished this, click 'add all'. 
- If you don't want to add any subcategories at this point, don't forget to click the 'save all changes' button at the top or bottom of the main page before you leave, or you will lose your new categories.
- If you need to add subcategories, see below.

### Adding Subcategories

Once you have set up your categories, you may want to add subcategories ('subsets') to them. For example, you might have 'Office' as your role category, then 'Reception', 'Filing' and 'Phoneline' as your subcategories. 
- Click on the name of the category that you would like to add subcategories to. If it is an existing category you may already see some subcategories listed here.  
**To add one new category:**
- Click on the 'add new sub-category'button.
- Type the name of the sub-category into the text box.
- Click 'update'. The sub-category will now be listed below the category.  
**If you're adding more than one new sub-category:**
- Click on 'bulk add sub-category'. 
- Type the names of the sub-categories you want to add in the pop-up box. Each one should be separated by a semi-colon (;), but you don't need any spaces between each one. For example 'Reception;Filing;Phoneline;Admin Support'.  
- When you have finished, click 'add all'. These will now appear in the list below the category.
- Before leaving this page, click the 'save all changes' button at the top or bottom of the main page or you will lose your changes.

### Editing Categories and Subcategories

Before editing or deleting categories, you need to consider that it will just be the name which you are changing. As a general rule, you should only change this if the meaning is staying the same, for example due to a spelling error. Any records with the category already selected will keep the data. For example, if you had a 'skills gained' category of 'Teamwork' which you changed to be 'Manual handling', any role which was previously recorded as offering skills in 'Teamwork' will now show as offering skills in 'Manual handling'.  

- Find the category or sub-category that you want to edit in the list and click on the pen and pencil symbol to the right of it. 
- Make your changes in the text box, then click 'Update'.
- It's possible to add and edit a number of different categories and sub-categories on this page, but don't forget to click the 'save all changes' button at the top or bottom before you leave. If you don't do this you will lose all your changes.


### Moving Items in the List

To the right of each list item is a series of buttons. The first two of these allow you to move an item up and down the list. You can use these to change the order in which the categories are displayed, or to change the order of the sub-categories within a particular category. 
- Press the 'up' arrow to move an item up, and the 'down' arrow to move it down the list.
- You can also use the 'sort' button which you will find above the list. Pressing it once sorts your list alphabetically (A-Z), while pressing twice sorts it in reverse order (Z-A).
- Click 'save all changes' at the top or bottom of the page to keep your changes. If you navigate away from this page before saving then all changes will be lost.

### Deleting a Category or Sub-category

Before you delete a category or sub-category, consider that any existing tags for these sub/categories will be lost, and you will no longer be able to search your {{volunteer opportunity}} records and {{volunteer application}}s for them.

You can delete a whole category with all its related subcategories in one go, or choose to remove single subcategories.

- Find the category or subcategory in the list. 
- Click on the grey dustbin icon to the right of it. Clicking on the dustbin for a category will also delete all associated subcategories. 
- The row you have selected will turn red. 
- If you have done this in error, clicking on the dustbin icon again will 'undelete' the item.
- Click 'save all changes' at the top or bottom of the page to keep your changes. Once you have done this you will not be able to undelete the item.

### Attendance Roles

You will also need to have two attendance roles, one for {{volunteering applicant}} attendances and one for {{opportunity provider}}s.  We will need to assign these for you - please contact us if this has not been done.
