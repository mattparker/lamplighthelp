# 27.2.1 Multimedia Module: Adding Media to Profiles

> Systems with the Multimedia Module will show a Media tab within profiles

To add media to a {{person}} or {{org}'s profile, first you will need to navigate to the one that you want, then open the 'Media' tab.

There are three ways to add media to a profile:

- Drag and drop a file into the grey area where media thumbnails are kept.

The dialogue box will ask you to add in more details about your upload:
•	Name: by default, if you uploading files from your computer, {{Lamplight}} will automatically assign the same name as the file. You can change this if you want to.
•	Description: help others to know what this upload is by adding a short description.
•	Web address: for when you are adding media from the internet. The address must include http://
•	Category: these are set up by your administrator (for more information on this see.......). Once the record is added they can be used to search for different categories of media.
•	Select file: browse your computer for the appropriate file.
•	Add to search index: by ticking this box you are asking {{Lamplight}} to index this new record so that you can search for it using the top search box. If you do this, {{Lamplight}} will try to open the file and read its contents, then add these, plus the file name and description, to the search index. To search in the top-right search bar you will need to put in the term you're searching for and then press 'Go'. {{Lamplight}} will search for indexed files match your search term.
 
When you have finished your upload, the media tab will show thumbnails of all of your files or links.
