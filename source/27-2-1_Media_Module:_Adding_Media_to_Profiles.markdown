# 27.2.1 Media Module: Adding Media to Profiles

> If you have the Media Module, there will be a 'Media' tab in profiles where you can see all the items which are saved for that 
{{person}} or {{org}}, edit the details, and add new ones

To add media to a {{person}} or {{org}'s profile:

- Open the profile that you want to add something to.
- Open the 'Media' tab.

There are now three ways to add media to the profile:

- Drag and drop a file into the grey area where media thumbnails are kept.

- Click the 'Add from internet' button where you can insert a link to online media in the 'web address' box.
- Click on the 'Select files' button and search for files on your computer to upload.
- In each of these cases, a dialogue box will open for you to fill in the details of your upload:
   - Name: by default, if you upload files from your computer {{Lamplight}} will assign the same name as the file. You can change this if you want to.
   - Description: you can add a short description to help to identify this upload.
   - Web address: for when you are adding media from the internet. The address must include http://.
   - Category: these are set up by your administrator (for more information on this see [27.1.0 Media Module Setup](/help/index/p/27.1.0)). You can search for records in the Media tab by category.
   - Select file: browse your computer for the appropriate file.
   - Add to search index: by ticking this box you are asking {{Lamplight}} to index this new record so that you can search for it using the top search box. If you do this {{Lamplight}} will try to open the file and read its contents, then add these, plus the file name and description, to the search index. To search in the top-right search bar you will need to put in the term you're searching for and then press 'Go'. {{Lamplight}} will search for indexed files match your search term.
- When you've finished your upload, the media tab will show thumbnails of your files or links (depending on the file type: see [27.2.0 Adding Records to the Media Module](/help/index/p/.27.2.0) for more details).
