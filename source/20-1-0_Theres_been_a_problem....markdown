# 20.1.0    There's been a problem...

> I've just tried to do something and got a message 'There's been a problem...'. What happened? 

One of two things. Either you tried to go to a web page in {{Lamplight}} that doesn't exist (less likely) or you've found a bug that we haven't. The technical details of the problem you've encountered are recorded. We check the logs regularly and fix problems as soon as we find them.
