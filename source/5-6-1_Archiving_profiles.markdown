# 5.6.1    Archiving profiles

> You are likely to archive profiles when {{people}} have stopped using your service day to day so you don't need to update their data or add new records, but you still want to include them in reports

When you archive a profile, any {{person}} or {{org}} that has been involved in work can still be counted in report, and it is possible to set up {{groups}} showing details of archived profiles. The archived {{person}} or {{organisation}} will not be found if you use the search box at the top right of your {{Lamplight}} screen however. 

**Archiving**
To archive a profile you will need to have manager level access to the system or above. Search for the profile that you want to archive and at the top right of the page, under the menu bar, click the archive button.  

**Reinstating archived profiles**
Only managers and system administrators have the permissions to unarchive profiles.
To find the one that you want go to the People tab above the menu bar, choose View->{{user}} (or whatever the role of the person you are looking for was)->All. Click in the large search bar above the table to expand it, and select 'Limit list to Archived people', then click the 'Fetch data' button on the right of the screen.

You now have a table showing all the archived people with that role type on your system. Once you have found the person you need to reinstate in this table, click on the menu to the left of their name (or right click anywhere in that row of the table) and choose the 'unarchive' option.

**Finding an archived profile though the duplicate warning**
When you create a new profile you may receive a warning of possible duplicates already on the system. This happens if Lamplight detects profiles with similar names to the one you're entering, and it checks archived profiles as well as current ones. If you see that the profile you're adding is already on the system, click on their name in the duplicates table.

This will open up their profile, and you if you are a manager or system admin you will see an 'unarchive' box at the the top right of their profile. If you do not 'unarchive' the profile, it is possible to add information to it (including personal data and activities records), however it will not be possible to find again when searching using the search box at the top of the page.
