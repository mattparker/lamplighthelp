# 20.2.0    I can't log in

>  

If you can't get to the login page at all, please email us at [enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk](mailto:enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk) or call on 020 7558 8793. 

The login page is only valid for 25 minutes or so. So if you've logged out, gone for lunch, and come back, you'll need to refresh the page (press the f5 key on your keyboard) before you try and log in.

If you've forgotten your password, we can send you a new one: click 'Get a new password' on the login page, enter your email address and the squiggly letters in the picture, and you should get one by email straight away. If you get a 'thank you' type message, but don't receive an email within 5 minutes, it's most likely that the email has been 'spam' filtered by your email software. If you can, check your spam message folder, or ask your system administrator to reset your password for you.
