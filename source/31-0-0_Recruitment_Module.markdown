The {{Recruiter}} module implements a highly opinionated approach to job applications and shortlisting. 
It's an opinion based on research but is different to a lot of the recruitment practice you see.
The module focuses on the application and shortlisting phase.

## 1. You are seeking capable people

You want applicants to carry out a role, for which they will need a set of capabilities.
Where and how they gained those capabilities isn't really relevant; whether they have them is the 
key question.

Traditional recruitment tends to beat around the bush.  For example, many job descriptions will require
GCSE English.  But it's highly unlikely you need a series of 1500 word essays about Romeo and Juliet.
What you actually need is someone who can write clear, engaging and empathetic letters / emails / tweets.
So why not ask for that?  By requiring a particular qualification when what you actually want is a particular
set of capabilities, you may be excluding a set of people who could do the job *really well*.

This approach to recruitment encourages you to re-write your job descriptions and person specificiations
to really focus on the skills and capabilities you need for the post.

You also need to think about whether the language you use in your adverts and job descriptions is 
inadvertently putting people off.  Requiring a "confident, ambitious leader with a logical approach"
will put women off from applying.  Re-phrasing to use less masculine coded language will fix this, 
without putting men off from applying.

## 2. So ask applicants to show you what they can do

No more "apply via CV and cover letter". Ask applicants specific questions that enable them to demonstrate
their capabilities.  So, instead of "Requirements: GCSE English", ask applicants to 
"draft a letter to a service user explaining because they've missed the last three appointments, we won't be 
able to see them again unless they are referred again."

You may find that applicants who were excluded from school and didn't get GCSE English will write 
just the sort of letter that you want to send - and they'll have the opportunity to show you they can.


## 3. Judge applications on their capabilities

Our brains are wired to take short-cuts.  Imagine popping to the shop and having to carry out a full
cost-benefit analysis of every possible different shortcut, considering your current nutrition levels,
past experience of different snacks, and the different nutrition to be gained from different options.
You'd never eat.

In recruitment our brains may be doing the same things - using perceived education, work experience, age, 
where someone lives, gender, names, ethnicity etc to make quick judgements about suitability.

But this information is not helpful when we're making decisions.  So remove all the clues that mislead us and focus on capability.

When you're shortlisting the {{recruiter}} module only shows you applicant responses to each question - you 
can't see any personal or demographic information, and there are no CVs.  And responses are presented
to make it most easy to compare responses from the different applicants and judge them fairly.

The contact and demographic information is captured, so you can in touch afterwards and run reports
to monitor your equalities performance.


## Module functionality

The Lamplight {{recruiter}} module is designed for smaller employers, to help with the initial
application and shortlisting process.  The process is:

 - create question sets that applicants complete when applying for a role
 - check language of text that may discourage people from applying
 - create {{recruiter}} campaigns that allow applicants to answer capability based questions
 - each member of the shortlisting panel when scores applications
 - scores are shown for all applicants
 - shortlisting decisions and reasons are made and saved
 - applicants can be emailed directly to share the good or bad news


## Credits

The functionality in this module has been inspired by a few folk:
 - Diverse Matters - https://diversematters.co.uk/ - who have helped Lamplight in our approach to 
 recruitment,
 - beapplied.com - a platform that offers similar functionality for larger employers.
 - https://twitter.com/craprecruitment - highlighting where Third Sector organisations 
can improve their recruitment practices

We added this module because we wanted to use it and couldn't find a product that would work
for us.  We've used this module and approach over three recruitment rounds over the last couple
of years and it's been such an improvement.  We get fewer applications, but they are excellent,
and the feedback from applicants (whatever the outcome) has been really positive.
