# 104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields

**Profile information for {{people}} and {{org}}s, for example demographics, is captured with custom tabs and fields**

{{Lamplight}} enables you to set up and customise the tabs and fields that appear on profiles. You can have as many of these as you need to capture different information. Different types of profile will have their own custom tabs. 

**Finding Your Profile Tabs**

**Add a New Tab**

- Above the list there are two buttons which you can use for adding new tabs - 'add new tab', which allows you to add tabs one at a time, and 'bulk add tab' which you can use if you are adding a number of new tabs.
  
1. Click on Add new tab

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 5](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_5.png)

2. Type in the new tab name

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 6](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_6.png)

3. Click on Change more settings for this tab

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 7](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_7.png)

4. The form will open
  - Type of {{person}} - you must choose what type or types of {{person}} this new tab is for. If you do not choose anything here then the new tab will not be visible on any profiles.
   - Roles - you can also choose to limit this tab to {{people}}, {{org}}s or {{family}} (if they are used in your system) with particular roles.
   - Restrict the field - ticking this means that only operators with a Manager or Administration level of access will be able to see the field and its contents.
   - {{Project}}s - if you have more than one {{project}} in your system, you can choose to share this tab so that it is also visible in other {{project}}s. When tabs and fields are shared, it is possible to report information across {{project}}s.
![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 8](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_8.png)

- Click on 'Add multiple items' button. This opens a pop-up box.
- Type the names of all the tabs that you are adding in the text box, separated by a semi-colon (;). You do not need a space before each one. 

**Adding Fields**

- Click on the tab that you would like to add fields to. If there are already fields in this tab you will see them listed here. If it is a new tab you will see the option to click to add a new field.

1. Click on Add new field

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 9](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_9.png)

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 12](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_12.png)

5. Choose the field details including type
   - If you have more than one {{project}}, you have the option to share this new field with other {{project}}s.
   - Which type of profiles it will be applicable to (both the type of {{person}} and the role). It is important that you fill these in, or the field will not be visible in any profiles.
   - The type of field required - there is detailed information on how to choose the best field type in [104.1 Custom Fields in Profiles](/help/index/p/104.1).

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 13](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_13.png)

6. Choose further details for your field
   -  Placeholder text, which will appear in your empty text box (for example 'Add the reason here') if you choose that field type.
   - Descriptive text which can be shown below the field as an explanation (for example 'only complete this if the previous answer was 'no').
   - Whether it is a required field (if you choose this option it will not be possible to edit the tab and save it without putting data in this field).
   - Whether to restrict the field to Managers and Admins. If you select this it means that database operators with lower levels of access will not see these fields or be able to add data to them.
   - If you have the Publishing Module, you can also specify whether data in this field can be published - although you will also need to authorise this for each individual profile before any data becomes available. See [48 Publishing Module](/help/index/p/48) for more information about the controls.

**Bulk Adding Fields**

1. You can create multiple fields in one go, click &#039;add multiple items&#039;
- These fields will all be created as a select field. You can change the field type before saving. Once saved you will be unable to change the field type.

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 21](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_21.png)

**Setting Options**
   
The field that you have just added may require some options (for example, if you've added a 'Current status' field, you might want the options 'Active' and Inactive'.) If it's a field that you have just added it you will see buttons allowing you to add options. If it is an existing field that you are editing, click on the field name then select the three dots ('more' button) on the right to see these 'add' options. 

**Add a Single Option**

- To add your options one at a time, click on the 'add new option' button. This opens a pop-up box where you add the text of your option
- Continue adding all the options you need in this way.

**Add a Number of Options at Once**

- If you have a field which provides a number of different options, click on 'bulk add option'. 
- Type all your options in the text box, with a semi-colon (;) between each one. You do not need a space before each new one. For example, 'Active;Inactive;Not known.'
- When you have finished, click 'add all'. They will appear in a list below the field name.

**Add from a Built-in List**

- Lamplight contains a number of built-in sets of options. To see what is there, click on the 'add from built-in list' button. They include yes/no; some demographic options such as ethnicity, gender, religion and language; number lists; days and months. If you would like to use any of these lists as options for your field, click on the circle next to the appropriate one then click 'add'. 
- Once they've been added to a field they behave like any other options, and you can edit them and add more if needed.

1. Add from a Built-in {{Group}}

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 22](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_22.png)

2. Form will open to choose built-in {{group}}s available

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 23](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_23.png)

**Linked Fields**

You may want to link fields together so that you can enter multiple records under a single field (for more on this see [16.7.1 Custom Fields in Profiles](/help/index/p/16.7.1)). Remember, if you do this you will not be able to use the data in the linked fields for reporting, creating {{group}}s or {{group}} data views. This is most suitable for historic information you need to hold but do not need to report on, such as previous addresses or notes that are required for day-to-day work which do not need to be analysed or filtered.
![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 24](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_24.png)

1. To link a field into a group, click on link fields

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 25](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_25.png)

2. Page will open providing options to create a new or include into an existing set

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 26](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_26.png)

3. Options available

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 27](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_27.png)

4. The field will be linked into the set

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 28](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_28.png)

- Continue adding options in the same way until all the fields that you want are linked to one another. 
- If you link an option in error, click the squared icon again to get the option to 'Remove this field from the linked set'.
- Once you have saved your changes using the 'save all changes' button at the top of the custom fields page, press F5 to refresh your system. When you look at the fields in the tab, you will now see that they are displayed as a table rather than separately.

You can create several groups of linked fields on the same tab. These links are indicated by the number displayed next to the squared icon on each option, and the colour of the bar to the left of the fields. Each field can only be included in one 'linked field' set. 


**Changing the Order of Tabs, Fields and Options**

You can re-order tabs, fields and options in the list, which will in turn change the order they are shown in the rest of Lamplight. To reorder tabs: 

1. Sort items alphabetically
- You can reorder all of your tabs alphabetically by clicking on the 'sort' button above the list. Pressing this button once will arrange the tabs in alphabetical order, while pressing again will sort them in reverse order.

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 29](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_29.png)

2. Moving tabs and fields using arrows
- Click on the field or option that you  want to move, then use the arrow buttons to the right of it
  
![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 30](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_30.png)

3. Delete tabs and fields

If you are thinking of deleting tabs, fields or options, be aware that once you do this you will no longer be able to filter, present information in reports, or create data views using any information already entered into them. However, the underlying data has not been deleted, and it is possible in some circumstances for Lamplight to reinstate it for you.

If you delete a tab, all of the fields in it will be deleted too. Similarly, if you delete a field, the options within that will also be erased.

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 31](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_31.png)

4. Will highlight in red

![104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields - step 32](104.2_Adding_and_Editing_Profile_Custom_Tabs_and_Fields_im_32.png)

 - Remember to click 'save all changes' at the top or bottom of the page before moving on, or the item will remain active.
