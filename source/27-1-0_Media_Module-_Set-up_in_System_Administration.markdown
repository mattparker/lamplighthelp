# 27.1.0 Media Module: Set-up in System Administration

> Before you use the Media Module you will need to set up file categories in system administration. These allow you to sort and filter your media files in a profile



When a file is uploaded to a profile it can be assigned a category so that it is easier to find. For example, you could classify things according to your process - application forms, {{referral}} forms, {{outcome}}s evidence and profile pictures, for instance. 

### Creating a File Category

System Administrator level access is required to configure the file categories. 

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Module Administration’ section, find the 'Media Module' section and click on 'File categories drop-down list'.

- If you already have some categories you will see them listed here. Scroll to the bottom of the list and double-click where it says ‘double-click to add’.  This brings up a text field. Type the name of the category in this box, then press 'enter' on your keyboard to save. 
- A new 'double click to add' field will appear at the bottom of the list. Continue creating categories as required.

### Editing and Deleting a File Category

You can edit the name of an existing category by double clicking over the text to open it up as a text box.  Once you’ve finished editing, click ‘enter’ on your keyboard to save your changes.

To delete a list item, drag it to the grey rectangle labelled ‘Drag here to delete’ at the bottom of the list of file categories.

It is not possible to delete a new file category immediately after setting it up. You will need to leave the file categories page, then re-open it.
