# 32 Creating and Editing Data Views

- You can set up as many {{group}} data views as you need in {{Lamplight}}, and each one can be used with any {{group}}. Like {{group}}s, the ones that you create will show in the {{group}} data views table for any database operator on your system to use. Dataviews can also be used to create Headers in profiles, add a Summary page in profiles, and to set different columns in the 'My {{user}}' section on your homepage, and the relationships tab.

1. Click on {{Group}}s on the top menu bar

3. Click on add a data view

![32 Creating and Editing {{Group}} Data Views - step 3](32_Creating_and_Editing_List_Data_Views_im_3.png)

- There are several tabs. Some of the ones you see (for example Evaluations and Communications) will depend on the modules or options that you have turned on in your system. Apart from the 'View name' tab, you only need to edit the ones which contain information that you want to include in your data view.
  
4. The first screen is where you&#039;ll need to give the data view a name and a description.
When you view the table of data views in the future the name is what you will see, so try and choose something that will remind you and other profile what it&#039;s for

5. Contact details
You can select which contact information you&#039;d like to see. Please note, if you use this data view with a {{group}}, the {{person}}/{{org}}&#039;s name will already appear by default so you won&#039;t need to include it here.

6. Relationships
You can show information in your data view about named individuals/{{org}}s that profiles of the {{group}} are linked to.
Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see the &#039;name only&#039; of the linked profile, or &#039;name and contact details&#039;.
If you select &#039;name and contact details for download&#039; you will get the same information as &#039;name and contact details&#039; but each field is separated by a pipe symbol - | - and empty fields are included.
This means that if you download the data and do &#039;text to columns&#039; you&#039;ll be able to get the data nicely. However it doesn&#039;t look so nice on screen if you just want to see the information in Lamplight.

7. {{User}} fields, {{Volunteer}} fields and {{Staff}} fields
The information in these tabs relates to the custom fields in the profile tabs of your profiles/{{org}}s. The options within these pages will be unique to your system.

6. {{Work}}, {{Referral}}, {{Grant}} and {{Outcome}}s tabs
These tabs pull data from their corresponding records. You'll only see tabs relating to these areas if you have those options turned on in your system.

- The 'General summary figures' section at the top of this page lets you select general information (for example number of records in the last month). Further down, the 'Detailed summary figures' section allows you to be more specific about the information you see in your data view. You will need to fill in the 'Detailed {{work}} data' to show what information you want about the records, as well as the date range of the data you want to see. There are other filters, such as {{workarea}} and location, which you can use to filter the records shown.

7. General summary figures
The &#039;General summary figures&#039; section at the top of this page lets you select general information (for example number of records in the last month).

8. Detailed summary figures
- The &#039;Detailed summary figures&#039; section allows you to be more specific about the information you see in your data view. You will need to fill in the &#039;Detailed {{work}} data&#039; to show what information you want about the records, as well as the date range of the data you want to see. There are other filters, such as {{work}} area and location, which you can use to filter the records shown.
- These more detailed sections differ from the rest of the dataview in that you are filtering in order to show specific data, rather than simply ticking a box.

9. Choose the date frame of interest

![32 Creating and Editing {{Group}} Data Views - step 11](32_Creating_and_Editing_List_Data_Views_im_11.png)

10. Choose which data is required
In the example below, the &#039;number of attendances&#039; has been selected. Please note this is a multi-select field, so you can select more than one.

![32 Creating and Editing {{Group}} Data Views - step 12](32_Creating_and_Editing_List_Data_Views_im_12.png)

11. Choose how to display the data

![32 Creating and Editing {{Group}} Data Views - step 13](32_Creating_and_Editing_List_Data_Views_im_13.png)

When you are finished, you can save your dataview. This won't immediately display data, as you have just selected columns and options which will display whereever you use the dataview. You can now use this dataview with {{groups}}, Headers, and in different places as determined in the Database operaters templates.
