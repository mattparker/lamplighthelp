# 16.9.0    Creating {{Report}} Templates

> A {{report}} template is a a way of saving the particular filters and display options for a {{report}} so that you can run it without having to re-enter them each time

{{Report}} templates are useful, for example, for regular management or funder {{report}}s, so that you don't need to create a new one each time. Although they are set up on system administration, the form is very similar to that on the one-off reports, and once they have been saved they can be chosen from the main report menu. 

You'll need to be a System Administrator to create templates.


**To Create a {{Report}} Template**

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Templates -> Manage report templates'.

- Once in this page, you will see options to add {{report}} templates for {{work}}, {{referral}}s, {{linked case}}s, {{outcome}}s, and any of the modules you have enabled.  You'll also be able to edit existing templates.

**Completing the Template**

- We recommend you create your {{report}} normally first, to ensure it's been created correctly and is showing appropriate data before recreating it in the {{report}} templates section. Once you have completed the template it will save and take you back to the {{report}} templates page, without showing you the results. For more on running a {{report}}, see [13.1.0 Running {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.1.0).

- The first page of the template is where you give the {{report}} a name, and a description, so that staff will know what {{report}} they are running, and can understand what it is designed to do.  We encourage you to be as specific as possible. The name of the report will show up in the list, and if you hover over it then the description will show too.
- You can also lock the report so that only you can edit it on this page.

The other difference when creating a {{report}} template, are the dates.  Within a template we have given you options to add dynamic rather than fixed dates.  You can choose for example to run the {{report}} from the beginning of the previous quarter, to the end of the previous quarter.  This will ensure that whenever you run the report, it will be reporting in the previous quarter.

Finally, when run, {{report}}s display the information requested in the template, but can then be altered, to break down the numbers in different ways for example.  This means that one {{report}} may be created as a template and then changed in a number of different ways, to more easily give a range of data for your reporting from a single {{report}}

**Viewing {{report}} templates**

As {{report}} templates show on the main menu in a drop-down menu under the {{report}} type.

You will need to refresh the page in your browser, using the F5 key, in order to see newly added reports.
