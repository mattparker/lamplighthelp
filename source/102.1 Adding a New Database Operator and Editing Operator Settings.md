The different levels of access that you can choose from are:

- **Receptionist:** intended for occasional or low level staff. Operators can add and edit their own records. Within profiles they are only able to view the contact details, relationships, {{work}} records and {{eval}}s tabs. They are unable to work with {{group}}s, {{outcome}}s, {{comm}}s or run {{report}}s.
- **Data entry:** intended for basic data entry use. Operators can add {{user}}s and {{work}} records, but may only view and edit records they have created. They cannot create {{group}}s or {{comm}}s, or delete data.
- **Staff:** intended for general staff members. Operators are able to do everything that 'data entry' operators can, and in addition can create {{comm}}s, view {{report}}s, work with {{group}}s, and create Excel exports.
- **Manager:** can do everything that '{{Staff}}' operators can, and additionally can delete activity records and archive profiles.
- **System Administrator:** has full privileges, in particular to the admin functions. This means they can create new database operators and change various settings as described in this chapter.
- **Reporting:** has full access to the {{report}}s in the system, but cannot view or edit any other information. This can be useful for trustees, for example, so that they can see aggregate performance data, but not access individual case notes or profiles.
- **{{Project}} Admin (where applicable):** has full system admin access as well as management of {{project}}s where a system has more than one.
