# 102.1 Adding a New Database Operator and Editing Operator Settings

**System Administrators can add new database operators to their system in the database operators' table. They can also go back to edit their permission level and other details**


**Please note: When you add a new database operator to the system, it will automatically create a new staff profile for them. If they already have a profile on the system it will be necessary to merge the two (see [108.1 Merging Duplicate Profiles](/help/index/p/108.1)). When you do this, make sure that the profile you keep is the new database operator one.**

![102.1 Adding a New Database Operator and Editing Operator Settings - step 6](102.1_Adding_a_New_Database_Operator_and_Editing_Operator_Settings_im_6.png)

2. Complete the form
   - The email address will be the operator's log-in.
   - Choose the operator role (see [102.2 Operator Permission Levels](/help/index/p/102.1).
   - You can choose to set an Operator Template for the operator. (See [103 Creating and Editing Operator Templates](/help/index/p/103)).
   - If you have multiple {{project}}s, tick the ones the operator will have access to. This does not share the operator's profile with these projects - that will need to be done separately - but it means that they will be able to view and edit information in them (depending on the access level). 
   - If you have log-in policies you can choose one here (see [120.2 Login Security Policies](/help/index/p/120.2)).
   - When you have finished, save.
   - When you add a new database operator {{Lamplight}} automatically creates a new staff profile for them and sends an email to their registered email account with their initial password.

**Password Issues**

If the new password does not arrive it is most likely to be an issue with the recipient's email spam filter. Most inboxes have a spam folder you can check. If you are using a dummy email address however, or are not able to locate it, you can reset the password.  

- In the database operators' table (see above), click on the menu to the left the new operator (you can also bring this menu up by right clicking on the relevant row in the table). 
- Choose 'Reset password'. The new password will be displayed in a pop-up box (it will also be emailed to the database operator.) 
- You can write down this password or take a screenshot and share it as appropriate.

The operator will need to change their password when they next login.


**Editing Existing Operators**

1. Find the operator you need to edit and click the menu button to the left of their operator ID
