> If you are sending us data, you should make sure that you do it securely over encrypted channels.  Email is not secure and should not be used for any personally identifiable data



You can send Lamplight a file within the system. You should never email personally identifiable information - email is not secure enough.

### To Send Data Securely

- Go to system admin.
- Find the 'File Transfer' section, and click on 'Send Lamplight a file securely'.

![Send a Secure File](16.14.0a.png)

Here you can put in a description of the file that youâ€™re sending and choose the file you wish to upload.  When you've finished, click 'upload file'. This will encrypt the file and send it directly to us. 

### Error Reporting

Sometimes you may experience a problem with Lamplight and need to contact us for support. If you wish to email us a screenshot or details about the problem, please ensure that you do not send any personally identifiable information. Take the screenshot to avoid such information or edit the image to blank it out. If you need to refer to a specific profile or other record, send us the ID, not the name (which is more helpful for us anyway).
