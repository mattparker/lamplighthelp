# 19.0.0 Audit Module

> The audit module keeps a log of everything that happens in your system, so you have a full
> history of operator actions and changes to your data.

The audit module keeps a log of every action carried out in your Lamplight system: operator logins, viewing records;
editing records; deleting things; updates - are all stored in a read-only register. These logs can be viewed and
searched by system administrators to see a full history of activity in your system. The module stores up to 5 gigabytes
of log data, after which it's archived.

You can view logs based on the person that made the change; the type of record or change that happened; or the record
that was affected. Full details of when, where, and who carried out every action are available.

This module will be helpful in a number of scenarios. You may have information security requirements to retain logs. You
may need log files to help you comply with quality standards or similar. You may need additional reassurance about data
confidentiality, and the ability to confirm who has viewed a particular record.

To turn a for the module go to system admin > change modules and tick the audit module box to turn it on in your system.
It will immediately start recording the actions that you carry out.
