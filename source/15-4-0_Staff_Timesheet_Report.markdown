# 15.4.0    {{Staff}} Timesheet {{Report}}

> {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s provide a breakdown of how {{staff}} time is spent, captured through the {{Staff}} Management Module



Information for {{staff}} timesheet {{report}}s is taken from {{work}} and non-contact records. 

### To Run a {{Staff}} Timesheet {{Report}}

- On the main menu go to {{report}}s -> more -> {{staff}} timesheet {{report}}. 
- Choose the filters you need as for any {{report}} (for more on this see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)).
- At the bottom of the page, click 'run {{report}}'.
- You will only see data for the {{staff}} that you manage.

### {{Report}} Presentation

The {{report}} presentation tab allows you to select how you wish to view the {{report}} data. 

#### Split Tables
- Split tables are a way of separating the data. For example, if you choose to split the data by {{staff}} name then your results will be shown in a separate table for each member of {{staff}}.

#### Row and Column Data
- Row and column data. You can choose which data to show in your rows and columns. For example, the table below shows {{staff}} names in the rows, and months as the columns. The numbers shown are hours.
