# 5.1.0 Profiles

> Every {{person}} or {{org}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. A profile is a way to store all the information you have about a person in one place

Each individual and {{org}} has a profile. You may have {{family}} profiles in your system too. The profile holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}, {{org}} or {{family}}. 

To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, start typing their name in the search box on the top right hand corner of your screen. {{Lamplight}} will predict the name that you are searching for, and when it appears on the drop-down list you just need to click on it.  You can search by name, postcode, Lamplight ID number, email address and date of birth.

A profile is made up of a series of tabs containing the information you want to store. Many of these tabs are customised to your organisation, and every system is different. However, almost all will start with 'Contact details'.  

The first tabs will contain demographic or other personal information, and the later ones hold information on the activities you do with them.

Each different type of {{person}} or {{org}} can have their own tabs. For instance, you can store one set of information for {{user}}s and a different set of information for {{funder}}s or your {{staff}}. You might see presenting needs and medical history for your {{user}}s, CRB information for {{staff}}, and information about application deadlines and criteria for {{funder}}s. 

If you have more than one {{project}}, you can choose whether to share existing tabs and fields, set up new ones for each {{project}}, or have a mixture of both. For more on {{project}}s, see [17.0.0 {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/17.0.0).

Your System Administrator can add new custom tabs and fields to profiles (see section [16.7.0  Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/16.7.0).
