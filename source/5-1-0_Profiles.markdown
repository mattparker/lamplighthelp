# 5.1.0    Profiles

> Every {{person}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. A profile is a way of bringing together all information about a person in one place.

Every individual and every organisation has a profile. This holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}. To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, start typing their name in the search box on the top right hand corner of your screen, when they appear on the drop-down list, click their name.  You can search by name, postcode, Lamplight ID number, email and date of birth.

A profile is made up of a series of tabs containing the information you want to store about these {{people}}. Every system will have different tabs, though almost all will start with the Contact Details tab.  The first tabs will normally contain demographic information or information about people, and the later ones information on the activities you do with them.

 You can store different information about the different kinds of {{people}} on the database. So, you can store one set of information for {{user}}s and a different set of information for {{funder}}s or your {{staff}}. For example, you might see presenting needs and medical history for your {{user}}s, CRB information for {{staff}}, and information about application deadlines and criteria for {{funder}}s. They can also vary for different {{project}}s in your system, if you have more than one.

Your system administrator can add tabs that you see, and the information on them.  (see section [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/p/18.3.0) for information about setting up tabs and fields, and section [3.7.0  {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/3.7.0) for more about {{project}}s).
