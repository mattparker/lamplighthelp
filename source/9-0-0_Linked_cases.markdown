> {{Linked case}}s are a way of linking different kinds of {{activity}} record ({{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{comm}}s etc.) together in one place. They allow you to track the amount of time something takes from start to finish



In most systems that use {{linked case}}s, you'll find their details in the '{{Linked case}} view' tab in their profile.  


(Your system may use a different name to the one in the image below).

They are a way of organising records within {{Lamplight}}, where you can bring together all the records belonging to a particular area the {{person}} or {{org}} is involved in. For example, if you are working with someone on a number of issues, one of which is housing, you could open a {{linked case}} called 'Jordan Lee - housing', and then connect all the {{referral}}, {{work}} and {{outcome}} records to that {{linked case}} so that all the information is visible in one place.

One person may have several {{linked case}}s, and each {{linked case}} may involve several different people.

Using {{linked case}}s you can: 
- Easily see all the records in each {{linked case}}.
- Assign a category (these will depend on what is set up in your system). 
- Report on how many days an individual or organisation has had a {{linked case}} open in a particular category (For example, we supported Jordan for 18 weeks, or the befriending relationship lasted 2 months).
- Report on what {{linked case}}s were open at a particular time.  For example you could show anyone who had an open Advice {{linked case}} at any time during August last year.  This also makes them great as status trackers.
- Depending on how they are set up on your system, you may be able to select different types of {{linked case}}, or record information such as why the {{linked case}} has closed.
