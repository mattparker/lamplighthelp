> A {{project}} in {{Lamplight}} is like a completely separate {{Lamplight}} system. You can have complete separation between {{project}}s, or introduce different levels of sharing. You can also run {{report}}s across all your {{project}}s


In {{Lamplight}}, a {{project}} is a self-contained system within the overall one. By default, the information within one {{project}} is not visible to other {{project}}s, and the settings for each {{project}} may be completely different too. 

You may choose to have several {{project}}s because:

 - you need to keep the data separate. For example, a youth club runs a sexual health clinic. Information about those who attend the clinic must not be seen by those running the youth club, but the clinic may need to see basic contact information for those already attending the club. Using {{project}} sharing, the clinic can have access to contact information, but the youth club will have strictly no access to information from the clinic, or who attended. 
- you have very different services that need completely different settings. It is easier for the staff and volunteers of each service if they only see the settings for their service.
- you are working on a program with other organisations. Each organisation needs the same fields in their database, and you have to be able to report across the {{project}}. However, individual organisations should not have access to each other's data. By running multiple {{project}}s in a single system the manager can report across all {{project}}s, or within each one separately, but staff within each {{project}} will only see information related to their work and clients.
