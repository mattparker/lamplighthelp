# 7.1.0 <i class="fas fa-hammer"></i> Adding a {{Work}} Record

> It is possible to add {{work}} records from the main menu, as well as from a profile



### To Add a {{Work}} Record from the Main Menu
- Go to {{Activity}} -> Add new -> {{Work}} on the main menu. 

### To Add a {{Work}} Record from a Profile
- Find the profile of a {{person}} or {{org}} who will be involved in this session.
- Open their '{{work}}' tab.
- On the right of this tab, click 'Add'.

Either of these will open a new work record:

![A New {{Work}} Record](7.1.0a.png)

There are several tabs on this record to fill in. You can find the details of these in the pages that follow. 

- [7.1.1 When and Where](/help/index/p/7.1.1).
- [7.1.2 Adding Attendance Details](/help/index/p/7.1.2).
- [7.1.4 Completing the Details Tab](/help/index/p/7.1.4).
- [7.1.5 Recurring {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.1.5).

A System Administrator can customise the system to add extra fields and tabs, so your system may differ to the example here (on this record the 'Volunteer Support' tab is a custom one). See section [16.7.3 Custom Tabs and Fields in {{Activity}} Records](/help/index/p/16.7.3) for more information about customising {{work}} records.

You may also see tabs that relate to modules your organisation has opted to add to the system. In the picture above, the 'Expenses' tab is part of a module.

When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right.
