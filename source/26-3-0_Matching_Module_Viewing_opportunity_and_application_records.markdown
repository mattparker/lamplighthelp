# 26.3.0 Matching Module - Viewing {{Volunteering Application}} and {{Volunteering Opportunity}} Records

> You can view all {{volunteering application}} and {{volunteering opportunity}} records from the main menu {{activity}} > view > ..., or in the profile of those involved

When you view the list of {{volunteering opportunity}} records from the main menu you will see a summary of the key
details:

![List of {{volunteering opportunity}} records](26.3.0a.PNG)

The table shows a summary of the {{volunteering opportunity}}, including the title and description, when it is
available, and the categories selected. This is intended to make it easier to look for suitable {{volunteering
opportunity}} records or {{volunteering application}}s manually. See [section 26.4.0](/help/index/p/26.4) for more on
{{Lamplight}} matching functionality.

The filters and sorting of the records is [similar to other {{activity}} records](/help/index/p/7.3), but the filters
for {{volunteering opportunity}} records allow you to search by availability and category:

![Filtering the list of {{volunteering opportunity}} records](26.3.0b.png)

Select the times or categories you require and click 'fetch data' to filter the list.

Similarly, if you are viwing the {{volunteering application}} table from the main menu you will see details of
applicants, their availability and what they are looking for. This will include specific requirements and practical
considerations if these have been recorded.

Opening the menu for a {{volunteering opportunity}} or {{volunteering application}} gives the popup context menu:

![Context menu for {{volunteering opportunity}} records](26.3.0c.png)

As well as the usual options, you can also match the record.  [Section 26.4 - matching records](/help/index/p/26.4)
explains how the matching works and the different options.

Clicking on the {{Volunteering application}} or {{Volunteering opportunity}} tab in a profile will show a list of
everything that {{person}} or {{org}} is involved in. You will also get the matching options on the context menus in
these tables, as mentioned above.
