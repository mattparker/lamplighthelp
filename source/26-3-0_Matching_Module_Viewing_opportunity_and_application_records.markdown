# 26.3.0 Matching Module - Viewing {{volunteering application}} and {{volunteering opportunity}} records

> View all {{volunteering application}} and {{volunteering opportunity}} records from the main menu {{activity}} > view > ..., or in the profile of those involved

When you view the list of {{volunteering opportunity}} or {{volunteering application}} records you will see a summary of the key details:

![List of {{volunteering opportunity}} records](26.3.0a.PNG)

The table shows a summary of the {{volunteering opportunity}}, including the title and description, when it is available, and the categories selected.  This is intended to make it easier to look for suitable {{volunteering opportunity}} or {{volunteering application}}s manually.  See [section 26.4.0](/help/index/p/26.4) for more on {{Lamplight}} matching functionality.

The filters and sorting of the records is [similar to other {{activity}} records](/help/index/p/7.3), but the filters for {{volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}} records allow you to search by availability and category:

Select the times or categories you require and click 'fetch data' to filter the list.

Opening the menu for a {{volunteering opportunity}} or {{volunteering application}} gives the popup context menu:

As well as the usual options, you can also match the record.  [Section 26.4 - matching records](/help/index/p/26.4) explains how the matching works and the different options.
