4. Click on &#039;Link to {{linked case}}’

**What to Look for If 'Link to {{Linked Case}}' Is Not an Option on the Menu**

- If a record is already linked to a {{linked case}}, you cannot link it to another. The 'link to {{linked case}}' option will be disabled (grey text). You will need to remove the link to the existing {{linked case}}. You will need to remove the link to the existing {{linked case}} first (see section [14.6 Removing A Link To A {{Linked Case}}](/help/index//p/14.6)).

- You also cannot link a record to a {{linked case}} which has been closed. In this instance you will need to re-open the {{linked case}} before you can attach the record.  For information on this, (see section [14.8 Reopening a Closed {{Linked Case}}](/help/index//p/14.8)).
