# 12.6.0 <i class="fa fa-users"></i> Editing {{Group}}s

> Once a {{group}} is set up, you can go back to change the filters when you need to



To edit a {{group}}:

- Click {{group}} -> view -> view all on the main menu. 
- Right- click on the {{group}} you wish to edit. 
- Select 'edit' from the context menu.

- The editing window will open. This is the same screen you see when adding a new {{group}} (see section [12.1 Creating an Auto {{Group}}](/help/index/p/12.1) or section [12.2 Creating a Manual {{Group}}](/help/index/p/12.2), depending on which type of group you are editing). 
- Make any changes you need, then click the 'Save' button in the bottom-right of the popup window. 

When you create a {{group}}, it is possible to lock it so that no-one else can edit it. If you do this, you will know when you come back to your {{group}} that the filters are exactly as you left them. 
- Either start a new {{group}}, or open one to edit.
- On the first tab ('{{Group}} name'), tick the 'Lock this {{group}} for editing' box at the bottom of the page.

- Save your changes.

## 'My users' restriction means you cannot edit manual {{group}}s.

If you are affected by the 'my user' restriction (meaning you are limited to what profiles you are able to access)
then you will not be able to edit manual {{group}}s.  This is because you won't necessarily see who's in the {{group}},
and when you edit it those profiles will be removed, without you realising (because you don't have access to them).
Higher level operators will need to edit the {{group}} in these circumstances.

See the ['my user' restriction](/help/index/p/16.12.6) manual pages for more information.
