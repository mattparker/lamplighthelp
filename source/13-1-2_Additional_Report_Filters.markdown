# 13.1.2 Additional {{Report}} Filters

> Every system has filters based on the custom fields. These can be found in the second 'Additional filters' tab

Each system will have custom fields that have been added so that {{Lamplight}} collects the specific information that an {{org}} needs. Every system is set up slightly differently, so the filters you see are likely to be unique to your organisation. They may look something like this:

### Things to Remember When Filtering:

**Date and Number Select List**
- 'Greater than or equal to': people with a value greater (or later) than or equal to the value you specify will be included.
- 'Less than or equal to': people with a value less (or earlier) than or equal to the value you specify will be included.
- 'Equal to': only those that match this number or date will be included.
- 'Between': people who have a number or date recorded on or between the two that you specify will be included.

**Multi-select List**
- 'Does have': people who do have an exact match to all the options that you select will be included.
- 'Does not have': people who do not have any of the options that you select will be included.
- 'Has at least one of': people who have at least one (maybe more) of the options that you select will be included.
- 'Has at least two of': people with at least two (maybe more) of the options that you select will be included.
- 'Has at least three of': people who have at least three of the options that you choose will be included.

**Single-select List**
- Does have: people who have the option you have selected in their records will be included. Those who have a different option or nothing recorded in this field will not.
- Does not have: people who have another option or none at all selected will be included.

Once you have finished selecting filters, scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'run' to get your {{report}}. The view will return to the top of the screen, and you need to scroll to the bottom again to see the {{report}}.
