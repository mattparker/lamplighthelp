# 50 Waiting {{Group}}s Module

**The {{Waiting List}} Module enables you to create {{waiting list}}s, manage them and run {{report}}s**

A {{waiting {{group}}}} is a {{group}} of profiles or {{org}}s. Lamplight records when they are added and removed, making it easy for you to keep track of, and {{report}} on, waiting times.

Unlike other modules in Lamplight, there is no set up in system administration.
To use waiting {{group}}s you will need to have {{staff}} level or above database operator access to the system.
