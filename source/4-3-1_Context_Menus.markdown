# 4.3.1    Context Menus

> Context menus appear when you right-click on the row of a table, use the Apple key click or click the menu button on the right of a table.. These menus give you various actions. 

Most tables have context menus. This means that if you right-click on a row of the table (Apple key-click on an Apple Mac) or click on the menu button, you will see a small menu appear. If you wish to use the menu button this will need to be enabled through the personal settings section on the admin menu. See section [18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0) for more on personalising {{Lamplight}}. 

![Context menu]({{imgpath}}15a.png)

The options on this menu relate to the row that you clicked on. Some of these menu items may be light grey, which means they are disabled. 

This is either because the option is not relevant (for example, you can't close a {{linked case}} that's already closed), or because you do not have sufficient access rights (for example, you are not allowed to delete records).
