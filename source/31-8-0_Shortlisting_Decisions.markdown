# 31.8.0 Making the Shortlisting Decision

> The panel view all the scores for all the applications and decide who to shortlist for interview.

Once all members of the panel have scored all the responses you can move on to make the shortlisting
decision.  Go to {{people}} > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns and find the correct campaign.  If
all questions have been scored, you'll see a button to 'View scores and make decision'.

When you do, you'll see a screen like this:

Each row is an application, with each question and the scores given in a column.  Applications
are ordered in order of the total score descending.

At this stage you can view single applications.  To open it in a new window, hold down the 'shift'
key and click on the application ID in the first column.  You'll be able to view the responses
to each question for that applicant.

In each cell of the table the large number is the total score.  In the small grey box you can see 
additional information, including the separate scores each panel member gave.  Where these are very
different the score is highlighted so that you can consider why you differed.

Having reviewed the scores and applications you can record your decision, and the reason for it.
Note that the reason could be shared with the applicant if you have included it in 
your email template.  If so, your reason should be a standalone paragraph that will be helpful to the
applicant.

You can save your decision as a draft and return to it later if you need to.  When you are sure, click
the 'confirm decision' button.

You will now see the names and contact emails of the candidates, and view (but not change) your decision
and reasons.
