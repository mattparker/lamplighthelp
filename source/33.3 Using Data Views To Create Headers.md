# 33.3 Using Data Views To Create Headers

You can set up {{group}} data views to use as header bars on profiles

If there is information about {{people}} or {{org}}s held on {{Lamplight}} that you would like to see at the top of their profiles, you can use a data view to show this. Without a header you's always see see a profile's ID number, profile type and role. The information you choose in the header will appear after that. This page shows you how to use existing Dataviews as a header, so you will need to have created the dataview you want first.

6. You will see a {{group}} of options of where you can set Data Views
- If you want a to use a different data view for some profile types (so you can differentiate between {{staff}} and users for example, you can choose different headers for different profiles in the following boxes.
- For example, ‘{{Group}} data view to use in {{person}} – {{staff}} profiles’, will select the header you see when you view a {{staff}} profile.
- If you select a default option and the different data views for some of the other profile types, the default will show in all profiles which don’t have a different data view selected.

- If you just use the default header for everyone, we suggest you ensure the box 'If you have a profile header list data view (above), show empty fields?' is unticked, as this means only fields completed and relevent for the profile you are in will show.
- You can also use the option to only show completed fields, whatever options you have chosen above. Some people choose to do this to reduce the number of empty fields shown for a profile in it's header.
