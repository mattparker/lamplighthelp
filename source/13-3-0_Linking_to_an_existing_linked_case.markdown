# 13.3.0    Linking to an existing {{linked case}}

When a record is linked to a case, it appears in the {{linked case}} view tab, within the {{linked case}} it is linked to, but also continues to appear in it's appropriate tab, such as the {{work}} records tab.

> You can link records to {{linked case}}s in two ways.  By right-clicking and select 'link to {{linked case}}'

Some systems have the 'Search' bar turned off in the profile {{work}} record tab, and other record tabs. (See [18.1.3 Global Settings])(/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.1.3).  If the search bar is not present, you can also drag and drop one work record onto another already linked record to quickly add it to the same case.
