The {{eval}} {{report}} presents summaries of completed {{eval}} questionnaires. The {{report}} shows each question, with the number (or percentage) of responses for each option
 
1. To start, click on &#039;{{report}}s&#039; on the main menu at the top of the screen

2. From {{eval}} {{report}} section, you have options you can choose from.

- You can create your own {{eval}} {{report}}, based on your own criteria. When you have run the {{report}}, you can save the data, and the {{report}} will close.
- You can run a {{report}} template. This is a {{report}} with the criteria pre-determined and set-up to be run whenever you want. Dates for {{report}} templates can be dynamic, for example, they will always show the previous quarter from when you run the {{report}}. Once you've run a {{report}} template you can change the criteria and presentation to show different results at that moment, without changing the template itself.
- If you are a System Adminstrator you'll also see the option to set-up new {{report}} templates.

Click on &#039;new {{eval}} {{report}} using your own criteria&#039;.

4. Click on &#039;{{report}} filters&#039; and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 

Enter the filter information as required. This is the same as for other {{report}} types (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)

At the bottom of the filters page there are two more options: 'Select '{{eval}}' and 'Select campaign' (you will only see the second of these if you have the {{Eval}}s Direct Module).

'Select {{eval}}', listing the {{eval}}s available. You have to choose one of these - the top option is always selected by default.

'Select campaign'. If you have the Datadirect Module you will also see this option. You can choose the one that you want to report on from the drop-down. If you do this, {{Lamplight}} will ignore the {{eval}} chosen in the 'Select {{eval}}' box above.

6. Click on &#039;{{report}} presentation&#039; and choose how to display your data 

In the '{{Report}} presentation' tab you can choose column data. If {{eval}}s have been linked to a particular {{person}} when they were entered, it is possible to split data using their demographic information. Use the drop-down box to choose a custom field the you would like to see as the column in your results table.

You can also, in the 'Show data as' field, choose whether you would like your results to be shown as a count of the number of responses for each question, or as percentages. The table below shows the percentages option. If you are looking at the percentages.

9. {{Eval}} Filters
Once you have run the initial {{report}} an extra tab will be added: '{{Eval}} filters'. This enables you to filter the {{report}} by responses to one or more questions. So you could say filter that you only see results for people who answered 'Yes' in question 4.

Select the filters you wish to use and run the {{report}} again for a smaller set of {{eval}} responses. The results in the tables will now be shown just for those people who gave the answers that you chose.
 
10. At the bottom of any table, there is the option to download and print
