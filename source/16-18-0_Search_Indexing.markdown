# 16.18.0 Search Indexing

> You may occasionally need to rebuild your search index to look for the profile and activity record information that you need

When you search for information using the search bar in the top right corner of the page, it uses a special search index to find information. Occasionally you may need to rebuild this - be aware that this can take a long time if you have a large number of profiles or records. 

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Data Management -> Rebuild free text search index for profiles / {{work}} etc records (depending on which one you need to rebuild).

- You will see the whirring circle in the top right of the page to show that {{Lamplight}} is working on this.
- Once it has finished a message will appear to show that the index has been updated.
