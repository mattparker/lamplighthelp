# 19.3.0    Profiles for {{staff}}, {{contact}}s, {{funder}}s and other {{org}}s

> The ability to maintain profiles for people and organisations other than your main {{user}}s varied in versions 2.x of {{Lamplight}}. These are now fully integrated in to the main system 

Version 3 of {{Lamplight}} offers you the same flexibilities with {{staff}}, {{contact}}s, {{funder}}s and {{org}}s as with {{user}}s. So now you can add tabs and fields for {{staff}}, send {{comm}}s to them, see what {{work}} they've been doing (members of {{staff}} 'attend' {{work}} records in the same way as {{user}}s), and even record {{outcome}}s for them.
