# 22.3.0 {{Eval}} Module: Viewing Existing {{Eval}} Records

> Once {{eval}}s have been entered into {{Lamplight}}, you can view a table showing all of them or go to a specific profile to view the ones for that {{person}} or {{org}} 

To view {{eval}}s records:
- Go to {{work}}-> view all-> {{eval}}s on the main menu. 
- A list of completed {{eval}}s will be shown. 

This screen is very similar to viewing {{work}} records or {{outcome}}s: see section [7.3.0  Viewing all {{work}} records](/help/index/p/7.3.0) for more information.

If you have added {{people}} or {{org}}s in the 'attendance' tab of the {{eval}} records, you can also view any responses the '{{eval}}s' tab on their profile.
