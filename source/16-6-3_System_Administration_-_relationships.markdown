# 16.6.3 System Administration: Relationships

> Relationships are a way of linking profiles to show their connections to one another. For example, they could link a person to an organisation, or a parent to a child 

Relationship types are added, edited and deleted in the same way as other drop-down list items previously described - see [16.6.0 System Administration: Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0).

To add a new one, or edit an old one, go to 'admin -> system administration -> Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down Lists -> People and Organisations -> Relation types between people'.

**Inverse Text**

Some relationships are reciprocal, with two different sides. For example, a parent and child, or employer and employee. If the relationship that you are adding is like this, then after adding the initial relationship, click on the 'double-click to add' after 'Inverse text' to add the second relationship type.

**Linked Records**

Relationships can be used in linked records: {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s, {{referral}} and {{comm}}s. 

If you decide to link records, then {{people}} or {{org}}s who have this type of relationship can be added to the attendance table of an {{activity}} record linked to each other.

When you use the search box in the 'Attendance' tab of a record, the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} you are searching for will appear there with the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} with whom they have a linked relationship.

If you choose this option (rather than the {{person}}'s name by itself}}), the record will be attached to both profiles and you will be able to report on the attendance of both of them.
