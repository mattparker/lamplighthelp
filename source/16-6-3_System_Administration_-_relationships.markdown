# 16.6.3    System Administration - Relationships

> Relationships are a way of linking profiles to show their connections to one another. They can link {{person}} to {{person}}, {{person}} to {{org}}, or {{org}} to {{org}}. 

Relationship types are added, edited and deleted in the same way as other drop-down list items previously described - see XXXXX.  

**Linked records**

When adding a new relationship type, you have the option to allow the relationship to be used in linked records: {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s, {{referral}} and {{comm}}s.

If you decide to link records, then {{people}} linked together by this type of relationship, when you type into the search box of the 'Attendance' tab on a record, the name of the {{person}} you are searching for will appear there with the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} with whom they have a linked relationship. If you click on this option (rather than the {{person}}'s name by itself}}, the record will be attached to both of them, will appear in both profiles, and you will be able to report on the attendance of both of them.
