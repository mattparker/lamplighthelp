# 7.1.5 <i class="fas fa-hammer"></i>  Recurring {{Work}} Records

> Recurring {{work}} records enable you to add many regular {{work}} records in one go



When you are creating or editing a {{work}} record, there is an option on the 'When and where' tab, under the time and
date, to create a recurring {{work}} record.

The most important thing to remember when setting up recurring records is that you are setting the details of the first
record, using the date and time that this will occur (which are likely to be on the same day, not across days or weeks
as it is for **one** session). You then ask {{Lamplight}} to repeat these details in repeated records.

For example, if you set up the record and ask it to recur every Wednesday for 6 weeks, you will end up with a separate
{{work}} record on a Wednesday for each of the weeks covered.

### Recurring Record Options

There are a number of options for how records can recur.

![Recurring Options](7.1.5a.png)

- Daily. You decide which days you would like this appointment to repeat on and the date when it will finish. The '
  until' date is non-inclusive, so if you would like them to finish on 11th April, the 'until' date will be 12th April.
  There is also the option to make this every 2, 3, 4 weeks etc., rather than recurring every week.

- Weekdays. This works as for 'Daily' above, but in the initial boxes {{Lamplight}} ticks Monday to Friday by default,
  rather than all 7 days.
- Weekly. As above, but the default is that the day of the week on which you are adding the record is checked. You can
  alter this and add more days or change the day completely as needed.
- Monthly. {{Lamplight}} will assume that you want the session to recur monthly on the same day as the initial
  appointment. You can set this to be every first, second, third, fourth or fifth, or last instance of that day in the month.

- Yearly. This will then recur every year on the same day, up to but not including the end date that you specify.
- Custom. You can choose custom dates for the appointment to recur on. It will be added at the same time as the original
  record on each of these dates.

### Managing Recurring Records

Once you have set up recurring records they are linked. The only thing that makes them different from each other is the
date. While this is the case, you can edit them all as a group. When you go to edit a {{work}} record (for more on this
see [7.2.1 Editing {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.2.1), when you hover over 'Edit' in the context menu there will be
the option to edit all recurring records.

When a single record has been edited it drops out of the group, and can only be edited again on its own.

This allows you to create a series of 'template' records for a coming period, and then as they happen you can edit each
individually to update with details of what actually happened.
