# 52.4.0 Drop-down Lists in System Administration

> There are a number of drop-down lists in {{Lamplight}}, and you can add, edit and delete list items in system administration 

System admin lists are used for adding options to drop-down menus, for example relationship types or {{linked case}} categories. {{Workarea}}s, {{subworkarea}}s and {{outcome}}s are also added as lists, as are custom tabs and fields. They all function in much the same way.
