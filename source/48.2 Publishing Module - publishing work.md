# 48.2 Publishing Module - publishing {{work}} records

To assist in publicising your events and advertising the services you offer to a wider audience, the publishing module
can share your {{work}} record information with your public-facing site.

If your settings allow {{work}} records to be published, this still does not happen by default. Each record individual record
needs to be shared separately. This is to ensure that confidential information isnâ€™t accidentally published.

As part of the system setup your [system administrator will have decided whether {{work}} records should be published](/help/index/p/134.2),
and if they are which fields within the record should be included. For example, you may want to publish the start and
end time but not the description of the event.

You can choose to publish either when you add a new record, or you can edit an existing one to allow this.

### To Publish a {{Work}} Record

- If the record you want to publish doesn't already exist, you will need to start by creating a new one (see section [7.1.0 Adding a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.0) for more information).
- If it is an existing record, find it and open it to edit (see [7.4.0 Editing {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.4.0)).
- Complete the necessary details in the 'When and where', 'Attendance' and 'Details' tab.
- Go to the 'Publishing' tab. You will see these options:

#### Publish this record via Lamplight API?

Allows the individual record to be published.

#### Title of record for publishing

Give the record a title, which you can use when publishing. You will need to check with your developer / website to
understand how this title is used on the public site.

#### Do you want to allow the addition of attendees through the Lamplight API?

If the system administrator has enabled it, you can also accept bookings via the API. This needs to be enabled on each
record. Checking this will allow people to add themselves to an activity through your site or app.

#### Maximum number of clients allowed?

If people can add themselves to the record through your site, this sets a maximum number who will be accepted. If you
have a limit to the number of people that can attend the record, it allows your website to know if a record is "full".
However the details of the attendances (i.e. names) of a record are never published.

### To Edit and Remove Sharing from a {{Work}} Record

- Find the record and choose 'edit' on the context menu (see section [7.4.0 Editing {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.4.0)).
- Edit any of the fields that you would like to change.
- If you want to stop sharing this record, untick the checkbox next to 'Publish this record via {{Lamplight}} API?'
- Save your changes.

Changes to publishing take effect immediately when the record is saved - this may include autosaving of {{work}}
records.
