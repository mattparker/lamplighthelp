# 12.7.1    {{Comm}}s - adding your MailChimp API details

> You need to tell {{Lamplight}} about your MailChimp account so the two systems can talk to each other, through the system admin menu. 

Once you've set up your MailChimp account, you'll need you API key. This is similar to (but not the same as) a username and password that one computer program uses to identify itself to another. 

There are instructions to find your MailChimp API key [on the MailChimp site](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key): follow these to get the API key. 

You need to enter this into {{Lamplight}}: your system administrator will need to go to Admin -> system administration -> change global settings. On the {{Comm}}s module tab enter the API key. This is a long and unpleasant strings of characters and numbers that you'll want to copy and paste from MailChimp to {{Lamplight}}. Click 'save'.

Once you have saved your API key, go back into the global settings -> {{comm}} settings and complete the fields that tell Lamplight which {{workarea}} you want to assign to {{comm}}s, who you want to receive notifications of unsubscribes and which MailChimp list you want to use.

Within MailChimp you will create a single list as an umbrealla for all of your mailings. As {{Lamplight}} syncs with MailChimp it creates segments of that single list.

{{Lamplight}} will now be able to start talking to MailChimp to set up and send email newsletters.
