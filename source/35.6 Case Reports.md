# 35.6 Case Reports

{{Linked case}} {{report}}s provide a summary of records in {{linked case}}s, and you can filter to show open, newly opened and closed {{linked case}}s within any time period

The {{linked case}} {{report}} can list the open and/or closed {{linked case}}s, showing how many records are associated with them in the period. It can also aggregate data across {{linked case}}s. If the {{linked case}} data is combined, it can be presented using profile information, for example.

Running a {{Report}}

1. On the main menu click &#039;Reports&#039; at the top of the screen

![35.6 {{Linked case}} {{Report}}s1 - step 1](35.6_Case_Reports1_im_1.png)

2. Click on &#039;new {{linked case}} {{report}} using your own criteria&#039; in the {{Linked case}} {{report}} box

3. Click on &#039;Report filters&#039;

![35.6 {{Linked case}} {{Report}}s1 - step 3](35.6_Case_Reports1_im_3.png)

4. Select filters you would like included in your {{report}}

Most of the filters are the same as for other reports (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)). At the bottom you have specific filters for {{linked case}} fields. These are custom fields and will be different for each organisation. What you see here will reflect your organisation's processes.

If you do not choose anything from these fields, then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

![35.6 {{Linked case}} {{Report}}s1 - step 5](35.6_Case_Reports1_im_5.png)

6. Under {{Report}} presentation you will see options under ‘How should dates be handled?’
You have a choice how the dates you have chosen at the top are used by the {{report}}:
- Include {{linked case}}s that were open during the period: Will include all {{linked case}}s that were open at any point during the date range
- Include {{linked case}}s that were opened during the period: Will include any {{linked case}}s that were opened (created) during the date range
- Include {{linked case}}s that were closed during the period: Will include any {{linked case}}s that were closed during the date range
- Include {{linked case}}s that were opened and closed during the period: : Will include any {{linked case}}s that were both opened and closed during the date range

How Should Rows Be Grouped?

The options in this drop-down come from your {{linked case}} categories as well as profile information. If you choose one of these, {{Lamplight}} will display the information in additional table rows.

7. Click on &#039;run {{report}}&#039; to view {{report}} results

![35.6 {{Linked case}} {{Report}}s1 - step 6](35.6_Case_Reports1_im_6.png)

The {{Report}} Results
Aggregated {{Linked Case}} {{Report}}
If you run a {{report}} which collates your {{linked case}} data across the timescale that you have chosen, it will show you:

Number of {{linked case}}s open at any time in the timescale chosen.
Number of new {{linked case}}s opened.
Number of {{linked case}}s that were closed during the period.
Number of {{activity}} records (including {{work}}, {{referral}}, {{outcome}} etc.) attached to any of the {{linked case}}s.
{{Linked Case}} {{Report}} table

Individual {{Linked Case}} {{Report}}
If you choose to group your rows 'by {{linked case}}' in the '{{Report}} Presentation' tab, then the table will show each {{linked case}} that fits your filter criteria in a separate row.
