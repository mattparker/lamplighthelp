# 8.3.0 Viewing All {{Outcome}} Records

> You can view all the {{outcome}} records on your system in one place. You can also filter the records you see by date, category and {{workarea}}, for example



### Viewing the Table

- Click on '{{Activity}}' on the main menu.
- Hover over 'view' on the sub-menu.
- Choose '{{outcome}}' from the drop-down list. 
- If you see a final sub-menu choose 'standard {{outcome}} listing' to start a fresh view. There will be other options which are saved {{activity}} view templates. For more on this, see [7.3.1 Viewing All {{Activity}} Records Using an {{Activity}} View Template](/help/index/p/7.3.1).
- You will see the following screen:

- The table shows all {{outcome}} records occurring within a set date range ordered by date latest in the range showing at the top.  
- The default range of dates shown (for example, all records from two months in the past to two months in the future) can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual. For more on this see [16.4.3 Personal Settings: Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3). 

**Choose and Save the Table Columns You See**

- You can choose which columns you see in the table by right clicking in the coloured header row.  This will show you a list of all the possible columns. If a column is ticked it will be visible in the table, and unticked items are hidden.  
- You can change this by clicking on the column you wish to show or hide. 
- If you want to make that change the default view, right click again on the header row, and from the bottom of the pop-up list choose 'Save table columns layout'.  These will now be the columns that you see by default when you run this type of table. This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  
- Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the standard system view.  (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, see below, these can also be saved.)

### The Table Search Bar

Above the table is a bar marked 'Search'. If you click on this then you will find additional options you can use to filter your records, and some extra columns to add. 

**Standard Filters**

The top section gives you filters that you can use to narrow down the selection of {{outcome}} records you see. 

![Searching for particular {{outcome}} records](8.3.0a.png)

- Date and time. You can choose the date range that you want the records to cover.
- {{Workarea}}. You can restrict the records to specific {{workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s. 
- {{Staff}} member adding record. This drop-down box lists all {{staff}} on the system. If you only want to see records added by a specific person, choose their name from the list. 
- Location. Use this to restrict your search to sessions which have happened in a particular place. 
- {{Outcome}} category. This will filter the records so that you only see ones related to a specific category.
- {{Outcome}} measure. This will filter the results to show records for a single {{outcome}} measure.
- Show deleted records. If you want to see deleted records in your search, tick this box. No current records will be included in the results. 

**Additional Data Columns to Display**

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  
- This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  
- Clicking here will give you options to display names of different {{people}} or {{org}}s who are listed in the records' attendance tables, as well as other items from the custom fields in your {{outcome}} records.

**Custom Field Filters**

The final search bar is called 'Custom field filters'. Click on the bar to open it. 

- This lets you select additional filtering options to narrow down your selection, using any custom fields that you have added to your records.  

#### After applying additional filters, click the 'Fetch data' button to show the matching records.

### The Context Menu

By right clicking on any row in the table, you can open a context menu for that record.

This gives you a number of options:
-	View full details: opens up the record on one page so that you can see all the details.
-	Edit: opens the record up in editing mode so that you can make any changes that you need.
-	Delete: Removes the record so that it will not be visible in the {{person}} or {{org}}’s profile, and will not be counted in reports or available in data views. However, it will still be possible to view it in this {{outcome}}s table (if you choose to ‘Show deleted records’ as a filter.
-	If you use {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see options to link, follow-up, remove link, close the {{linked case}}, edit the {{linked case}} and view the details from here.
-	If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you can ‘communicate’ from here. This opens up a new {{comm}}s record, with everyone involved in the {{outcome}} added as a recipient. 


### Downloading and Printing the Table

**Downloading to a Spreadsheet**

- Just above the table, make sure that the 'Show' drop-down is set to 'all'. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the table and click the 'Download' button.  
- Depending on your browser, your table may immediately open in a spreadsheet, or you may need to click on a 'Download' box at the bottom of the screen to open it.

**Opening Print View**

- Clicking the ‘Print’ button at the bottom of the table will open it in a new tab in a printer-friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print-friendly tables split by whatever item you choose, for example {{workarea}} or {{outcome}} category. Each one will open in a separate tab.
