> This section is for creating, editing and saving your email signature



You can use the box and editing tools here to create your email signature.

Click the plus sign at the top right of the box to display full editing options, including the ability to add images: 
 
![Open Text Box Editing Toolbar](16.4.4a.png)

![The Comms Signature Box Editing Toolbar](16.4.4b.png)


Once you have clicked 'save' at the bottom of the page, this signature will automatically be added to emails, letters and SMS text messages when you create them in {{Lamplight}} (although you can remove the text).  It will show as a mail merge option when creating {{comm}}s.
