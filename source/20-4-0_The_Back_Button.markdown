# 20.4.0    The Back Button

> You can navigate back and forwards using the buttons on your browser. 

You can navigate back and forwards using the buttons on your browser. 

Note that if you have just saved a record, pressing 'back' will not un-save it or take you to the form with the details filled in. Also, the page that you go back to will be reloaded, so if information has changed since you last viewed the page it will be updated. For example, if you view the diary, then add a new {{work}} record and save it, and then use the back button to go back to the diary page, you'll see the new {{work}} record you just created.

There is a problem with older versions of the Opera browser that means that the history manager will not work. This is a known limitation of the browser (see the YUI site, if you're interested). Recent versions (10.10 on Windows tested) seem to work.
