# 28.7 Auto Lists- Case Fields

The &#039;{{Linked case}}s&#039; tab is where you search for profiles based on cases they are linked to.

You can look for profiles where {{linked case}}s were opened and closed using specific dates, find all profiles with {{linked case}}s of certain category or profiles with {{linked case}}s which have been open for a particular amount of time.

1. Click on &#039;{{Linked case}}s&#039; tab in the Auto {{group}}

2. Choose the criteria you want to use to add profiles to the {{group}}
- Include profiles if a {{linked case}} was opened in the profile, or if the profile is {{group}}ed on an {{activity}} connected to the {{linked case}}
- Include profiles with {{linked case}}s only if they were opened in that profile
- Include profiles with {{linked case}}s only via {{group}}ings on {{activity}} records - this will only include profiles where the {{linked case}} was opened in the profile if they are also included in a linked {{activity}} record

3. Use the {{linked case}} name and {{linked case}} description to filter your records
These are text fields, so you can filter your {{group}} using records where the {{linked case}} name or description contain certain words
- Exact match - will look to match the search term exactly
- Match anywhere - will match the search term anywhere in the profile name
- Starts like – will match to profile names that start with the search term
- Is empty - will show results where the field is empty

5. For the fields &#039;Date {{linked case}} was opened&#039; and &#039;Date {{linked case}} was closed&#039; you have 4 options
- On or after: {{linked case}}s opened/closed on or after the date you specify will be included
- On or before: {{linked case}}s opened/closed on or before the date you specify will be included
- On: only {{linked case}}s opened/closed the exact date will be included
- Between: {{linked case}}s opened/closed on or between the two dates you specify will be included
- You can choose a fixed date or use a dynamic date (E.g start of last month). Dynamic dates will use the date on which you’re running the {{group}}.
