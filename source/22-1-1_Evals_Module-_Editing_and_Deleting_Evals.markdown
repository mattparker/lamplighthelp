# 22.1.1 {{Eval}}s Module: Editing and Deleting {{Eval}}s

> Before editng or deleting {{eval}}s, consider the effect this may have on existing data



It is possible to edit and delete existing {{eval}}s in {{Lamplight}}, but there are some consequences to this that you will need to consider before you do so:

- If an {{eval}} is deleted, the {{eval}} records remain and can be viewed in '{{activity}} -> view -> {{eval}}s, or in the ‘{{Eval}}s’ tab of a profile (if the {{eval}} has been linked to a profile when it was entered (for more on this see [22.2.0 Adding and Editing {{Eval}} Responses](/help/index/p/22.2.0).
- It will no longer be possible to report on the {{eval}} results or filter based on them, as there will not be the option to select that {{eval}} on the report filters page (for more on {{eval}} reporting see [14.2.0 {{Eval}} Report](/help/index/p/14.2.0)
- If a field or field option is deleted in a particular {{eval}}, although it will still be possible to run a report on that {{eval}} it will no longer be possible to use the field as a filter in reports.
- If a field option is changed, the data that has been recorded against that field to date will remain the same. For example, if an option is changed from ‘Science’ to ‘History’, all previous responses related to ‘Science’, will now relate to ‘History’. It may be more appropriate to remove an option and add a new one.

### Editing {{Eval}}s

{{Eval}}s are edited in the same section of system admin as they were created in.

### Editing the {{Eval}} Name
- Select the {{eval}} you wish to edit in the left column.
- Double-click the non-bold text ‘{{Eval}} title’ in the middle column.
- Change the name of the {{eval}} at the top of the dialogue box.
- If you have more than one project, choose which this {{eval}} applies to.
- Click the ‘save’ button.

### Editing or Deleting a Field or Field Option
- Select the {{eval}} in the left-hand column.
- Select the field in the middle column.
- Double-click the non-bold text ‘Question’ in the right-hand column. This opens a dialogue box in which the field name and type can be changed.

**Be careful:** existing data can be hidden by changing the field type (for example, if a ‘Text box’ is changed to a ‘Select box’, previous responses will no longer be visible). However, the information is retained in the system, and will be made visible again by changing the field back to its original type. If you are uncertain about this, please call Lamplight support.

- To edit a field option, double-click it in the right-hand column. This will open a dialogue box to let you change the wording of the option.
- To delete a field option, click the ‘Del’ button next to it.

### Deleting {{Eval}}s

Before deleting {{eval}}s, make sure that you have run all the reports you will need from it. Once the {{eval}} data is no longer needed, go to the page where you add and edit {{eval}}s:
- Click the ‘Del’ button immediately to the right of the {{eval}} name in the left-hand column.
- A prompt will appear asking for the deletion to be confirmed. If you are sure, click the ‘OK’ button.
