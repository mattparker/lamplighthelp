# 9.1 Viewing Work Records in the Profile

**When you choose the '{{Work}} records' tab in a profile, you will see a table showing all the {{work}} that that profile is listed on, whatever their role or attendance.**

1. Click on {{Work}} records tab in a Profile

2. Click on sort arrows to arrange the column
   
You can sort the table by what is in a column by clicking at the top of a column. Click again to reverse the order. For example, clicking at the top of the &#039;Date&#039; column will sort the records from earliest to most recent. Clicking again will reverse this.

3. The default setting for viewing {{work}} records is 5 to a page but this can be changed.

Use the &#039;Number of rows to show&#039; dropdown box to decide how many rows you would like to see at a time

4. You can use the page numbers below the table to move through the records, or the &#039;Go to page&#039; box to go straight to a specific page number.

5. To see other columns that are available to view, right click on the coloured header bar of the table. This will bring up the full {{group}}, and you can tick and untick one at a time to add and hide columns.

By default, the table will show the date of the record, the name of the {{work}} area, the summary field, the number of profiles {{group}}ed in the attendance table and the number of those attending who were users.

You may also see other columns, depending on whether you use {{linked case}}s, or have any modules.

6. Each {{work}} record in the table has a context menu to the left of it. If you can&#039;t see these, then you can also bring up the same menu by right clicking on the table row. This menu has a number of options:

- View activity: This opens the {{work}} record in a popup window so that you can see all the information on one page.
- Edit activity: This opens the data entry window where you can change the details of the {{work}}, for example add new attendees or follow-up details. See section [7 {{work}} Records - Adding New](/help/index//p/7).)
- Duplicate activity: You can use this to create an exact copy of the {{work}} record which you can then edit as you like. This can be useful if you are creating a similar record for a different date. Be aware this will copy all content, including notes from the 'Details' tab.
If you use {{linked case}}s in your system you will also see these options (See section [14 {{Linked case}}s - Opening, Closing and Linking Records](/help/index/p/14) for more information):
- New communication to profiles on activity (you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module):Choosing this option opens a new {{comm}}s record (See section [17 {{Comm}}s - Creating and Editing](/help/index/p/17) for more on {{comm}}s) and enters the names of the {{people}} that attended the piece of {{work}} in the 'Recipients' table.
- Link to {{linked case}}: This is one of the places where you can add this {{work}} record to a {{linked case}}.
- Follow up {{linked case}}: Choosing this option duplicates the {{work}} record, opens the duplicate for editing and saves it in the same {{linked case}}. This is a quick way to create a new record in the same {{linked case}} if it shares details with the original {{work}} record.
- Remove link to {{linked case}}: You can remove this {{work}} record from the {{linked case}} it is attached to.
- Close {{linked case}}: If your {{linked case}} is finished, this option will flag it as closed.
- Re open {{linked case}}: It is not possible to add records to a closed case. This option will reopen a {{linked case}} that has previously been closed. You will then be able to attach more records to it.
- View {{linked case}} details: This opens a list of {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s that are linked to that {{linked case}}.
- Edit {{linked case}} - If you click on this option it takes you to a screen where you can edit the details of the {{linked case}} itself.
- Add {{outcome}}s: This option opens the {{outcome}}s data entry window (see section 8.1.0 Adding {{outcome}}s from the Main Menu Bar for more on {{outcome}}s). The date, time, {{workarea}} information and {{people}} who attended the piece of {{work}} will be added automatically to the draft {{outcome}}s record.
- Archive activity: This action is only open to database operators with a Manager or Administrator level of access. It archives the {{work}} record so that it is not immediately visible in tables.
