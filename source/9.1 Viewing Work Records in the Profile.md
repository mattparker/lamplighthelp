2. Click on sort arrows to arrange the column
You can sort the table by what is in a column by clicking at the top of a column. Click again to reverse the order. For example, clicking at the top of the &#039;Date&#039; column will sort the records from earliest to most recent. Clicking again will reverse this.

5. To see other columns that are available to view, right click on the coloured header bar of the table. This will bring up the full {{group}}, and you can tick and untick one at a time to add and hide columns.
By default, the table will show the date of the record, the name of the {{work}} area, the summary field, the number of profiles {{group}}ed in the attendance table and the number of those attending who were users.
You may also see other columns, depending on whether you use {{linked case}}s, or have any modules.

6. Each {{work}} record in the table has a context menu to the left of it. If you can&#039;t see these, then you can also bring up the same menu by right clicking on the table row. This menu has a number of options:
