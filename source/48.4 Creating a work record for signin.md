# 48.4 Creating a {{work}} record for use with the sign-in module

{{Work}} records have to be published to be visible to the public sign-in page. If you allow addition of attendees in
the record, then QR codes can be used to register.

### Publishing {{work}} records to appear on the sign-in page

When creating a {{work}} record that you want to appear on the sign-in page, you will need to make sure it is published.
One of the tabs in the 'new {{work}} record' tab is 'Publishing'. Tick the first box to publish the record and make sure
it appears on the sign-in page.

The title you enter here will be the main thing identifying the session on the sign-in page, along with the time and
location. You can use the sign-in page simply as a "what's on" display board without any of the sign-in functionality.
If you just want to list this record without any option to sign-in or out, then leave the next tickbox 'Do you want to
allow the addition of attendees through the Lamplight API' unticked.

If you do tick it, so that users can sign in and out, you can set a maximum number of users allowed. Once this threshold
is reached, {{Lamplight}} will no longer allow people to sign in. However, this number is the total number listed, and
only relates to the total number of people listed on the attendance table. So if you reach the maximum attendees, and
someone signs out, {{Lamplight}} will still not allow more people to be added via the sign-in page.

#### A sign-in page for a single record

When you save a published record and view full details of it, you'll see the publishing section looks something like
this:

This QR code and URL is for the sign-in page just for this record. This allows you to use the sign-in page in a
particular room, say, and makes sign-in slightly simpler as the person signing in doesn't need to choose which event
they are attending. The {{work}} record will also appear on the main sign-in page.
