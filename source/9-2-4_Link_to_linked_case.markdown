# 9.2.4    Link to {{linked case}}

> A '{{linked case}}' in {{Lamplight}} is a series of {{work}} or other records linked together. 

Different records can be linked together into '{{linked case}}s' (see section [13.0.0  {{Linked case}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.0.0) for more on {{linked case}}s). To link a {{work}} record to an existing {{linked case}}, or to create a new {{linked case}}, click 'link to {{linked case}}' on the context menu.

If a record is already linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is closed, you cannot link it to another. The 'link to {{linked case}}' option will be disabled (grey text). You will need to remove the link to the existing {{linked case}} first (see section [13.4.0  Removing a link to a {{linked case}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.4.0) ) if you wish to link the record to another {{linked case}}.
