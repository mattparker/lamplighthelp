   - The 'Title' is what you will see as the header for the item in your library.
   - The 'Message' is any additional information you want to add - this will be visible below the title in the library.

To create a new tag, write it in the box and click 'add new tag' on the right-hand side of the screen. When it has been successfully attached it will appear within the library item, as seen in the image below:

- If it is in the diary, click on it, if it is in a table of records click on the context menu button to the left, or right-click directly on the record itself.
- Choose 'View full details'. 
- When the record opens, click on the 'Add to library' button on the top right hand corner. 
- This opens up the same dialogue box as above, allowing you to add a title, message, tags and  a category.
