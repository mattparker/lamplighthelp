# 28.3.0 Publishing Module: Publishing to the Remote Site

> Once you have set up the settings to decide what information can and cannot be shared with your website, you will need to decide which records to publish on an individual basis

Profile and {{work}} record information is not automatically shared with your website even when you have made your decisions about what types of information you would like to be available. To ensure that no data is on your website which you do not want to be there, you will need to specify which records you want to publish.
