# 16.7.1 Custom Tabs and Fields

> You can set up and customise tabs and fields that appear on profiles and {{activity}} records. There are number of different types of field that you can choose to capture your information. 

You can set up as many custom tabs and fields as you need in your system to capture information. These can be in profiles, where they are often used to collect demographic information, for example, as well as on {{activity}} records to record data specific to your organisation. 

If you add a custom tab to a profile, then once you have saved it, it will appear in the line of tabs under the main menu (as long as you have it enabled in your personal settings - see xxxxxxxxxxx).

If you add a custom tab to an {{activity}} record, you will see that as a tab at the top of the window when you open a new record.
