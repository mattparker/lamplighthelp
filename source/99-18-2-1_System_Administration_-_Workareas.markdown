# 18.2.1    System Administration - {{Workarea}}s

> Current {{workarea}}s are shown in bold, with the {{subworkarea}}s listed below them. 

{{Workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s are managed in a similar to other lists within the system administration menu (see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0) ).:

![Editing {{workarea}}s and {{outcome}}s]({{imgpath}}145a.png)

Always create and type in your {{workarea}} heading initially, so that it appears in bold, before adding the {{subworkarea}}s below it. We would recommend that colours are added AFTER the headings have been entered. To colour co-ordinate your {{workarea}}s, double-click over **Background colour**, select the colour by moving the cursor around the colour pad, and click **save changes** to save.
