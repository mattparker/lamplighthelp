> This video shows you how to add and view {{outcome}}s data in an individual’s profile. It also takes you through adding {{outcome}}s by starting from the main menu.

Hello everyone, this is Libby from Lamplight.  Welcome to Part 5 of  Basic Training -  An Introduction to Entering, Editing and Viewing {{Outcome}}s.

You can download a transcript of this video if it’s helpful for you to be able to read along, and you can pause the video at any time to try out what we’ve done in your own system.  We’d encourage you to do this regularly during the video – after all you can pause as often as you like.  We’ve found practice is by far the best way of learning.

### {{Outcome}}s

An {{outcome}} is where you ask the same person exactly the same question on multiple occasions, for example at different stages in your work with them.  
Each answer is normally given a numeric value – so you might ask a client to rate the statement ‘I’ve been feeling good about myself’ on a scale of 1 to 10.  The answers given at different times to the same question are then compared to measure the difference you’ve made.  
An {{outcome}} can be added for any type of profile – {{user}}, {{volunteer}}, {{staff}} or {{org}}.

### Adding an {{Outcome}}
There are several ways to add an {{outcome}}. Most people will add an {{outcome}} from the profile, and that’s what we’ll do first in our test client, Sam Carter.

I’m going to search for Sam in our test system using the search box in the top right of the screen.  Once I’m in her profile I’ll go to the {{outcome}}s tab.

If you have more than one {{outcome}} type in your system, you’ll see a drop-down list of all of them at the top of the tab page.  Clicking on this will let you choose which {{outcome}} measure you want to view or enter.  I’m going to choose the top one, which in this system is the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale.  

The radar chart on the left of the screen shows you the scores for each time an {{outcome}} has been entered. For any set of {{outcome}}s measures, each spine of the radar chart relates to one question, and you’ll see the text at the edge.   Whenever you enter an {{outcome}}, the answers are automatically transferred to show on the radar chart.

Yours may be empty, so let’s add some results so we can see how it looks.

In the middle of the screen you’ll see a box called ‘Mode’, and in there, an ‘add’ button.  Click this, and the screen will change.
Alter the date if needed – the date you choose should be when the {{outcome}} was actually measured and not when you are recording it in {{Lamplight}} -  then enter a {{workarea}}, and if needed, a {{subworkarea}}.  

Once you have done this you can enter {{outcome}}s scores in two different ways.

- Firstly you can enter them by clicking directly on the radar chart itself.  Hover your mouse over one of the numbers on the top spine, and you’ll see the cursor change to a hand.  Click on the number, and you’ll see it change colour.  Now move to the next spine to the right, and do the same.  As you repeat this, you’ll see that you’re drawing a line around the chart.  You can complete the entire chart this way if you choose.

- Alternatively, you can scroll down the page a little to the number entry section.  Here you’ll see each {{outcome}} question, and a box for the score.  You can enter the score with the keyboard or use the mouse to click on the arrows to the right of the box, moving up and down through the numbers.  Each {{outcome}} score has a number range to choose from, and you must enter a number within that range.  You can also use the tab key to move though these boxes quickly.  If some of the boxes are already completed, it’s because they have filled in as you entered the {{outcome}}s directly into the radar chart.

You can record yes/no {{outcome}}s in exactly the same way as you record numeric scores.  In our training system, the {{outcome}} ‘Achievements’ is a yes/no measure.  You can simply choose Yes or No from the drop-down list.

The ‘Comment’ box allows you to write a small comment against each measure, should you choose.

The ‘My work’ tick box is used by some organisations and can be unticked if a particular {{outcome}} is not related to your work, such as a sudden dip in {{outcome}}s because of bereavement.

Whichever way you enter the {{outcome}} results, you must always scroll to the bottom and click save. 

Once saved, {{Lamplight}} will go back to showing you the results for the first set of {{outcome}}s in your list.  If you’ve just entered one which was not first on the dropdown list, you’ll need to choose the appropriate set of {{outcome}}s again to see the results.

Why don’t you try entering a first set of results for your test {{person}}, and then a second set for the same {{outcome}} with better results? This will show you how progress looks on the radar chart.  

### Viewing the Radar Chart

If you take a look at the radar chart now, you’ll see the two {{outcome}}s you’ve entered displayed on the chart.  In the centre of the page you’ll see a button called ‘Play slideshow’.  Clicking this will show you the {{outcome}}s in the date and time order in which they were entered, allowing you to see progress.

You can save an image of the radar chart at any point by right clicking on it, and choosing ‘save image as’.

### Viewing Individual {{Outcome}}s

If you scroll down the page, there is a table where you can see the individual {{outcome}}s entered for this {{person}}, with the date and score for each time they were recorded.  Each individual {{outcome}} measure (or question) is stored separately.

### Alternative Ways of Entering {{Outcome}}s

You can also add {{outcome}}s from the main menu, and this displays in a slightly different way.  Depending on your system this may be more useful for you.

In the main menu go to {{Activity}}-> Add New-> {{Outcome}}.  This will open a new record. The first page of this is ‘‘When and Where’.
Enter the date (and time if important), {{workarea}}, and location if relevant.

Your next tab may be called Attendance or Respondent. This is where you search for the profile of the {{person}} whose {{outcome}}s scores these are.  If you are not sure how to use these fields, please see the {{work}} records video.

You then see tabs for each different {{outcome}} type in your system, and can complete multiple {{outcome}}s for one {{person}} in the same record.

You can also see any notes which have been entered for an individual {{outcome}} question.  In our training system, the {{outcome}} type ‘Family Situation’, has guidance built in, and when you enter an {{outcome}} in this way, you can see the guidance next to each question.

If you have any custom tabs in {{outcome}}s, you’ll also be able to see and complete them here.

Once we’ve entered all the {{outcome}}s we need, again we click the ‘save’ button in the bottom right of the screen.

We suggest you take a short while to repeat what you’ve learned in your own system, referring back to this video if useful.  

This is the end of our core basic training.  Thank you for watching, and we hope you’ve found these videos useful.
