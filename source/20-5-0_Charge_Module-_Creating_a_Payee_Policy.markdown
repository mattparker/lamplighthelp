# 20.5.0 Charge Module: Creating a Payee Policy

> Once you have created payee rules, you will need to make payee policies so that you can apply them to your {{work}} records. Each policy can consist of a single rule or multiple rules combined together



### To Add a New Payee Policy

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Module Administration -> Charge Module -> Manage charge module rules and policies'. 
- Click the 'Create new payee policy' button.

First you need to give the policy a name: this is how you will choose the correct policy when you're in the {{work}} record, so it needs to be clear.

The section on the right of the screen shows all the payee rules you have created, and in the centre there is a space to add the rules you need.  To add a rule to the policy, simply click and hold the mouse button on the rule, drag it to the centre, and release the mouse button. The rule will appear in the central frame.  You can add more rules in the same way, and can remove them by dragging them from the central list to the right-hand side.

The order of the rules is important as they will be applied in the order that they are listed. 

In the example above, {{Lamplight}} will first apply the rule that the Council pays for attendees in its area. After that it will look at the second rule which says that all attendees pay 100%, and apply it to those who were not covered by the first rule. The final result is that where Councils do not pay, the attendee will be charged for the session. 

To change the order of the rules in your policy, just drag and drop using your mouse to put them in the correct place.

When you have finished, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right hand corner and you will return to the charge module menu. Your new payee policy will be listed, and is now available to use in {{work}} records. 

### To Edit a Payee Policy

To edit an existing policy, click on the name of the policy from the main screen.

Move the rules to the position that you want them in, remove rules, or add any more that you need to the policy.  

**Note that if you do edit a policy, the changes will not be applied to existing records - payments already calculated will remain as they are. However, if you edit a {{work}} record and keep the same policy, payees will be re-calculated when you save the record. It may be better to create a new policy in these circumstances.**
