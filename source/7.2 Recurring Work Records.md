# 7.2 Recurring {{Work}} Records

**Recurring {{work}} records enable you to add many regular {{work}} records in one go.**


When you are creating or editing a {{work}} record, there is an option on the &#039;When and where&#039; tab under the time and date, to create a recurring {{work}} record.

**Recurring Record Options**

There are a number of options for how records can recur.


**Daily** - You decide which days you would like this appointment to repeat on and the date when it will finish. The &#039;until&#039; date is non-inclusive, so if you would like them to finish on 11th April, the &#039;until&#039; date will be 12th April. There is also the option to make this every 2, 3, 4 weeks etc., rather than recurring every week.

**Weekdays** - This {{work}}s as for &#039;Daily&#039; above, but in the initial boxes Lamplight ticks Monday to Friday by default, rather than all 7 days.

**Weekly** - As above, but the default is that the day of the week on which you are adding the record is checked. You can alter this and add more days or change the day completely as needed.

**Monthly** - Lamplight will assume that you want the session to recur monthly on the same day as the initial appointment. You can set this to be every first, second, third, fourth or fifth, or last instance of that day in the month.

**Yearly** - This will then recur every year on the same day, up to but not including the end date that you specify.

**Custom** - You can choose custom dates for the appointment to recur on. For each record you want to add, find the date you want in the calendar, then click ‘add date’. You will see all the dates in the box at the end of that row

**Managing Recurring Records** - Recurring records are linked. The only thing that makes them different from each other is the date. While they remain the same, you can edit them all as a group. To do this, hover over &#039;Edit&#039; in the context menu there will be the option to edit all recurring records. (for more on this see [7.4 Editing {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.4)

When you edit a single record it is removed from the group and can only be edited again on its own.

This allows you to create a series of &#039;template&#039; records then edit update each individually with details of what happened.
