# 17.5.0    {{Eval}} {{report}}

> The {{eval}} {{report}} presents summaries of {{eval}} questionnaires completed. The {{report}} shows each question, with the number (or percentage) of responses for each option. 

On the '{{Report}} filters' tab there is an additional option, 'Select {{eval}}', listing the {{eval}}s available. You will need to select the relevant {{eval}} from this list.

The {{report}} will produce a series of tables, one for each question in the {{eval}}.

If {{eval}}s have been entered as linked to a particular {{person}}, it is possible to split data by background factors of those {{people}}, using the 'Column data' drop- down.

Once you have run the {{report}} initially, an extra tab will be added: '{{Eval}} filters'. This enables you to filter the {{report}} for responses to one or more questions. Select the filters you wish to use and run the {{report}} again for a smaller set of {{eval}} responses. In the example above, you may wish to see the responses for people who felt the course did not meet their expectations, to try and establish why not.

![{{Eval}}s {{report}} - question filters]({{imgpath}}138b.png)

The results in the tables will now be shown just for those people that said 'no' to the first question.
