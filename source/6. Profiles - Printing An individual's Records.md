2. Your print button may have a downwards arrow to the right of it. Clicking on the down arrow shows the print templates that have been set up in your system. Select a print template from the menu if required
A print template will be ready configured to only print certain parts of the profile, and possibly add custom text, styles, and your logo.

3. This will open a new window. On the right-hand side of the new window, there is a print menu where you can select the information that you wish to print. Deselect the tabs that you do not wish to provide in the document.

4. By default, the information from each tab will print on a separate page. If you want to collapse them into a single continuous document tick the &#039;Print without page breaks?&#039; box towards the bottom of the print menu. Click on print when happy with your selections
You can choose whether to print to paper or pdf by selecting the appropriate option from your print dialogue box.

# To Print Details of Multiple Profiles
It is possible to use a {{group}} to print details from a number of profiles in one document.
5. Click on {{Group}}s on the main menu bar

6. Click on the context menu (3 lines in a box) for the {{group}} you wish to print and choose Print {{group}} member profiles
This opens the same print menu as for the individual profile, above. You can select which sections of the profiles you would like to print from here.
Please note: if you do this for a large {{group}} it will take some time and may slow down Lamplight as it has to load all information from all tabs for all the profiles in the {{group}}.
