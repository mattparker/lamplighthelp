21.1.2 {{Comm}}s Module: Types of Logged {{Comm}} and {{Comm}} Roles

> With the {{comms}} module you can create a list of types of {{comm}} which you can then log in your system. You can also assign different profile roles to {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in these {{comm}}s

### Adding a {{Comm}}s Role

When creating a {{comm}} record, each profile involved is assigned a role. By default, each profile will be either a {{user}} or an {{org}}. This list can be expanded and appears in the ‘Recipients’ tab when sending a communication.

### Editing a {{Comm}}s Role

- Double click on the role that you would like to edit.
- The box will change to a text field which you can edit. 
- Once you have finished press ‘Enter’ (the return key on your keyboard) to save it.

### Deleting a {{Comm}}s Role

- Drag the list item you would like to delete into the grey ‘Drag here to delete’ box at the bottom of the list. 
- The role will appear in the grey box, confirming that it is being deleted.
- If you have just created the list item, you will need to go to the main system administration page then return to the 'edit communication roles' page before you can delete it. 


### Add, Edit and Delete Types of Logged Communication

With the {{comm}}s module, you can log communications that have come in to you. When you do this, there will be an area in the record for you to specify the type of communication (email, letter, SMS etc.) from a list. 

This section of 'Manage communication settings' allows you to add, edit and remove types of communication from the list. 

Follow the process in the '{{Comm}} Roles section above to add, edit or delete items in this list.
