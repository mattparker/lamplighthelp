# 16.7.0 Custom Tabs and Fields

> You can set up and customise tabs and fields that appear on profiles and {{activity}} records. There are number of different types of field that you can choose to capture your information. 

Profile information for {{people}} and {{org}}s is captured via custom tabs and fields. We also use custom tabs and fields in {{activity}} records.

.  

You can set up as many custom tabs and fields as you need in your system to capture information. These can be in profiles, where they are often used to collect demographic information, (for example you may need a custom tab called ‘Personal’, or ‘Registration', holding fields like Gender, or date of birth), as well as in {{activity}} records to capture data specific to your organisation. 

If you add a custom tab to a profile, then once you have saved it, it will appear in the line of tabs under the main menu (as long as you have it enabled in your personal settings - see xxxxxxxxxxx).

If you add a custom tab to an {{activity}} record, you will see that as a tab at the top of the window when you open a new record.

**Understanding Terminology**

- Tab - this is the place where the information will be found. It might be in a profile, or added to a {{work}} record.

- Field. This is the category of the information that you want to collect, for example 'Gender', or 'DBS Notes'.

- Options. These are the different things that would appear in a list to choose from  - for example, Male, Female, Non-binary, Other. A notes (text) field will not need any options. All databases use options lists so that you can break down information for reporting. You can use text fields to enter free text, but it is often not possible to report on these.
