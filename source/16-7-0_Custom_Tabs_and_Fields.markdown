# 16.7.0 Custom Tabs and Fields

> You can set up and customise tabs and fields that appear on profiles and {{activity}} records. There are number of different types of field that you can choose to capture your information



Profile information for {{people}} and {{org}}s is captured via custom tabs and fields. We also use custom tabs and fields in {{activity}} records.

You can have as many custom tabs and fields as you need in your system to capture information. These can be in profiles, where they are often used to collect demographic information (for example you may need a custom tab called ‘Personal’, or ‘Registration', holding fields like gender, or date of birth), as well as in {{activity}} records to capture specific information that you need for reporting on your work, for example. 

Once you have saved a custom tab in your profile it will appear in the line of tabs under the main menu (as long as you have it enabled in your personal settings - see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2)).

If you add a custom tab to an {{activity}} record, you will see that at the top of the page when you open a new record.

### Understanding Terminology
- Tab - this is the place where the information will be found. It might be in a profile or added to a {{work}} record (see above).

- Field. This is the information that you want to collect, for example 'Gender', or 'DBS Notes'. Each of the questions in the illustration below is a separate field.

- Options. These are the different things that would appear in a list to choose from  - for example, Male, Female, Non-binary, Other. A notes (text) field will not need any options. All databases use lists of options so that you can break down information and use it for reporting. It is usually not possible to report on text fields.
