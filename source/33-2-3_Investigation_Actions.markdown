# 33.2.3 Investigating a {{safeguarding case}} - Investigation Actions

> Investigations Actions are the things you do to investigate a {{safeguarding case}}. For example, adding a note of a meeting, or
> updating the status of a {{safeguarding case}}, are actions.

Once a {{safeguarding case}} has been raised, investigators and safeguarding managers can carry out various actions on the {{safeguarding case}} to
move the investigation forwards. The actions available depend on the status of {{safeguarding case}}.

### Severity

The severity of a {{safeguarding case}} is an indication of the level of risk you judge the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} to be under. There
are five levels of severity. 

To change the severity of a {{safeguarding case}}, select the relevant one from the drop down list and click save. The severity is
displayed with an !, and is colour coded – redder is more severe.

Severity is displayed in the following places

 - On the main listing page
 - On the profile of the person at risk
 - At the top of the detail page
 - On the dashboard.

Any changes to severity are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. You may need to also add a comment to explain the change (see below).

### Status

The status represents the status of the investigation. These are:

1. New {{safeguarding case}} raised
2. Under internal investigation
3. Under external investigation
4. Waiting for external reports
5. Ongoing issue
6. Requires manager sign-off
7. Signed off
8. Closed

The status can be changed at any time by selecting the new status from the drop down list and clicking save. The status is displayed on the main listing page, In the detail panel, and on the dashboard.
Changing the status also affects which actions are available.

Any changes to status are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. You may need to also add a comment to explain changes. The system allows you
to go "backwards" in status, but we would suggest that you add explanatory comments if you do so. 

Concerns that have 'Ongoing issue' or 'Closed' status will generally not be shown in the main {{safeguarding case}} listing page, to make it easier
to manage current {{safeguarding case}}s. 


### View other {{safeguarding case}}s

Early in an investigation you may need to check whether the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} has had other {{safeguarding case}}s raised. You
may also need to know if others connected to that person have too. Knowing this will help you to establish whether the
{{safeguarding case}} that has been raised is part of a larger pattern that you should be aware of.

To view any {{safeguarding case}}s that may be relevant, click the button. This will open a pop up window showing any concerns that
have been raised about the same person, or about anyone with a relationship to this person.

This table will list summary information about the concerns, but to review them more fully you will need to click on the
name of the concern. This will open up the details available to you.

Note that if you are not an investigator on the other concern, the information available to you may be quite limited.
You may need to speak to a Safeguarding Manager or the relevant investigator in this situation.

### Notes

Notes are detailed records of your investigation. They can be added by the investigator or by a Safeguarding
manager. To add a case note click the button in the main action panel.

This will take you to a screen similar to adding work or other activity records. As with them, select the work area,
location if relevant, and, if others were involved, their names in the involving tab. Full text notes can then be added
in the details tab.

If you have the media module on your system you can add files to case notes. If you do so, the contents of the files
won’t be visible directly in the main concern detail screen, and nor will they be when you print the concern details.
This may influence whether you attach the file or include the content in the text fields of the Note.

When you click save you will return to the main concern detail screen, with the Note you have just created at the
bottom of the listing, as records are shown in chronological order of when they were added.


### Comments

Comments can be made by any operator during the investigation of a concern.  They are simple text notes that add
snippets of information to the investigation.  Comments can be made on particular notes within the investigation, on or 
the concern overall.

To add a comment to the concern, type your text in the main action panel and click save. You will see the comment in the
main timeline.

To add a comment to an existing Note, type your text in the box that immediately follows the note details.



### Shared text

It may be necessary to provide some information to the rest of your organisation about the concern that has been raised,
without providing full details. To do this, you can add text in the box. When you do this, the date, severity, and text
you have entered will be shown in the profile header area when viewing that profile.

In a multiple {{project}} system, you can choose whether the text is visible in all projects that the profile is visible in,
or just the current one. Set this by ticking the checkbox below the comment text.

To change the shared text for a concern, simply type the new text into the text box and save it. This will update the text. A
record of the changes is shown in the concern timeline.


### Print

A print view of the concern is available that splits the concern into sections, and provides the same controls available
when printing profiles. A new tab will open showing all the details of the concern. You can print directly, or to pdf if
needed.

### Edit other information

Some custom fields may be editable at some stages of the investigation- it will depend on the settings for any custom
fields you have set up. To make any changes, click the 'edit concern data' button. An edit form will open showing any 
fields that may be changed.

All changes to these fields are logged within the concern timeline.

The fields available for editing may vary depending on the status of the concern. Your system may be set so that you cannot
change certain fields after a particular point in the investigation.


### Set to Sign off

You may require a safeguarding manager to sign off a concern before it is closed. To assign it to a Safeguarding
manager, change the status and click save. Safeguarding managers will receive an email notification asking them to review
and close the concern.

You will now see that most actions are locked to investigators. A Safeguarding Manager will now need to review the
concern and sign it off.

### Sign off

A Safeguarding Manager will see the 'Sign Off' action. To do so, add any final text the Safeguarding Manager wants to add
and click the save button. This will add the final comment and change the status of the concern to 'Signed off'. Only
Safeguarding Managers can sign off a concern.


### Add Final Report

When a concern has reached 'Signed off' status, you may wish to add a Final Report. This is a review of the concern, any lessons
learned, or actions required. To add a Final Report click the 'Add Final Report' button and complete the details as needed.

These records can be viewed alongside others from other concerns. They should not include detailed information about the
concern itself, but be focused on the process and any wider issues that the concern raised.

### Closing a concern

To close a concern, simply update the status to Closed.
