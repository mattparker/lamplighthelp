# 33.2.3 Proceeding with a {{safeguarding case}} - Actions

> {{Safeguarding}} Actions are the things you do to process a {{safeguarding case}}. For example, adding a note of a meeting, or
> updating the status of a {{safeguarding case}}, are actions.

Once a {{safeguarding case}} has been raised, {{safeguarding lead contact}}s and {{safeguarding}} managers can carry out various 
actions on the {{safeguarding case}} to move it forwards. The actions available depend on the status of {{safeguarding case}}.

### <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"> Severity

The severity of a {{safeguarding case}} is an indication of the level of risk you judge the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} to be under. There
are five levels of severity. 

To change the severity of a {{safeguarding case}}, select the relevant one from the drop down list and click save. The severity is
displayed with an !, and is colour coded – redder is more severe.

Severity is displayed in the following places

 - On the main listing page
 - On the profile of the person at risk
 - At the top of the detail page
 - On the dashboard.

It is only visible to {{Safeguarding}} Managers and {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s.

Any changes to severity are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. You may also need to add a comment to explain the change (see below).

### <i class="fas fa-route"></i> Status

The status represents the status of the {{safeguarding case}}. By default these are:

1. New {{safeguarding case}} raised
2. Internal fact gathering
3. Preparing internal reports
4. External investigation
5. Waiting for external reports
6. On-going issue
7. Requires sign-off
8. Signed off
9. Closed

The status can be changed at any time by selecting the new status from the drop down list and clicking save. The status is displayed on the main listing page, In the detail panel, and on the dashboard.
Changing the status also affects which actions are available.

Any changes to status are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. You may need to also add a comment to explain changes. The system allows you
to go "backwards" in status, but we would suggest that you add explanatory comments if you do so. 

Concerns that have 'Ongoing issue' or 'Closed' status will generally not be shown in the main {{safeguarding case}} listing page, to make it easier
to manage current {{safeguarding case}}s. 


### <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i> View other {{safeguarding case}}s

Early in the process you may need to check whether the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} has had other {{safeguarding case}}s raised. You
may also need to know if others connected to that person have too. Knowing this will help you to establish whether the
{{safeguarding case}} that has been raised is part of a larger pattern that you should be aware of.

To view any {{safeguarding case}}s that may be relevant, click the 'View related {{safeguarding case}}s' button. 
This will open a pop up window showing any {{safeguarding case}}s that
have been raised about the same person, or about anyone with a relationship to this person.

This table will list summary information about the {{safeguarding case}}s, but to review them more fully you will need to click on the
name of the {{safeguarding case}}. This will open up the details available to you.

Note that if you are not a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or an {{safeguarding lead contact}} on the other {{safeguarding case}}s, 
the information available to you may be quite limited.
You may need to speak to a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or the relevant {{safeguarding lead contact}} in this situation.

### <i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Notes

Notes are detailed records of your work on the {{safeguarding case}}. They can be added by the {{safeguarding lead contact}} or by a {{Safeguarding}} 
Manager. To add a case note click the button in the main action panel.

This will take you to a screen similar to adding work or other {{activity}} records. As with them, select the {{workarea}},
location if relevant, and, if others were involved, their names in the involving tab. Full text notes can then be added
in the details tab.

If you have the media module on your system you can add files to case notes. If you do so, the contents of the files
won’t be visible directly in the main concern detail screen, and nor will they be when you print the concern details.
This may influence whether you attach the file or include the content in the text fields of the Note.

When you click save you will return to the main concern detail screen, with the Note you have just created at the
bottom of the listing, as records are shown in date order of when they were added.


### <i class="fas fa-comment-alt"> Comments

Comments can be made throughout the processing of a {{safeguarding case}}.  They are simple text notes that add
snippets of information to the investigation.  Comments can be made on particular notes within the investigation, on or 
the concern overall.

To add a comment to the concern, type your text in the main action panel and click save. You will see the comment in the
main timeline.

To add a comment to an existing Note, type your text in the box that immediately follows the note details.

We see Notes as the detailed records of a {{safeguarding case}}, and Comments as post-its or scribbles in the margin.


### <i class="fas fa-comment-medical"></i> Shared text

It may be necessary to provide some information to the rest of your organisation about the {{safeguarding case}} that has been raised,
without providing full details. To do this, you can add text in the 'Add Shared Details for the team' box. 
When you do this, the date of the incident and text you have entered will be shown in the profile header area when viewing that profile.

In a multiple {{project}} system, you can choose whether the text is visible in all {{project}}s that the profile is visible in,
or just the current one. Set this by ticking the checkbox below the comment text.

To change the shared text for a {{safeguarding case}}, simply type the new text into the text box and save it. This will update the text. A
record of the changes is shown in the {{safeguarding case}} timeline.


### <i class="fas fa-print"></i> Print

A print view of the concern is available that splits the {{safeguarding case}} into sections, and provides the same controls available
when printing profiles. A new tab will open showing all the details of the {{safeguarding case}}. You can print directly, or to pdf if
needed.

As well as the visual layout, the print view differs in that the "process" elements of the timeline (who did what when)
are separated from the substance bits - Notes and Comments.


### <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> Toggle messages

As a {{safeguarding case}} proceeds the number of messages in the timeline will grow. If you need to hide them temporarily
to view the substance of Comments and Notes, click the 'Toggle messages button'. System messages, about changes to the
{{safeguarding case}}, are temporarily hidden. Click the button again to view them.


### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Edit other information

Some custom fields may be editable, depending on the settings for any custom
fields you have set up and the current status of the {{safeguarding case}}. 
To make any changes, click the 'edit custom fields' button. An edit form will open showing any fields that may be changed.

All changes to these fields are logged within the concern timeline.


### <i class="fas fa-pen-fancy"></i> Set to Sign off

You may require a {{safeguarding}} Manager to sign off a concern before it is closed. To assign it to a {{Safeguarding}} 
manager, change the status and click save. {{Safeguarding}} managers will receive an email notification asking them to review
and close the concern.

You will now see that most actions are locked to {{safeguarding lead contact}}s. A {{Safeguarding}} Manager will now need to review the
concern and sign it off.

### Sign off

A {{Safeguarding}} Manager will see the 'Sign Off' action. To do so, add any final text the {{Safeguarding}} Manager wants to add
and click the save button. This will add the final comment and change the status of the {{safeguarding case}} to 'Signed off'. Only 
{{Safeguarding}}  Managers can sign off a {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> Add Final Report

When a {{safeguarding case}} has reached 'Signed off' status, you may wish to add a Final Report. This is a review of the {{safeguarding case}}, any lessons
learned, or actions required for the organisation to improve your practice in the future. 
To add a Final Report click the 'Add Final Report' button and complete the details as needed.

These records can be viewed alongside others from other {{safeguarding case}}s. They should not include detailed information about the
{{safeguarding case}} itself, but be focused on the process and any wider issues that the {{safeguarding case}} raised.

### Closing a {{safeguarding case}}

To close a {{safeguarding case}}, simply update the status to Closed.
