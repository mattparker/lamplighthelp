# 12.1.4  <i class="fa fa-users"></i> {{Auto group}}s: {{Outcome}} Fields

> The '{{Outcome}} Fields' tab is where you can search for {{people}} based on their {{outcome}} scores, or changes in their scores, for a particular measure



You can look for {{people}} with a specific score, those who have changed over time or those who have maintained a score for a specified period of time. 

Bear in mind here that {{Lamplight}} treats yes-no {{outcome}}s as 1 - 0 (i.e. a 'yes' is stored as 1, and a 'no' as a 0), so to find {{people}} that have the answer 'yes' recorded against a specific {{outcome}} you'll need to enter the '{{Outcome}} score' as 'Equal to' '1'. 

### {{Outcome}}

To use {{Outcome}}s to filter your group, you must choose an individual measure from the '{{Outcome}}' drop-down box at the top of the page.  It is not possible to filter on more than one.

#### Date of {{Outcome}}(s)

You can limit the search to specific dates. (Options for date fields in the {{Outcome}} tab function the same as in the {{Work}} tab - for more on this see [12.1.3 {{Group}}s: {{Work}}, {{Referral}} and {{Grant}} Fields](/help/index/p/12.1.3). 
For example, you can find {{people}} who have ansered they 'feel positive about their life' in a specific static timeframe or if this is a {{group}} you'll need to run regularly, you can set a 'dynamic' timeframe so it will alter the dates based on the present date, such as the 'current month'.

#### Duration {{Outcome}} Score Maintained

The duration option gives you the chance to filter your list to show only people who had that {{outcome}} score for at least a given amount of time. Using the duration option will give you people that achieved that {{outcome}} and still had it (or there were no subsequent entries) within that time period. 

If you use the duration option without a date, {{Lamplight}} will use the latest {{outcome}} recorded as its reference point.


### Earliest or Any {{Outcome}}

This section relates to the earliest score recorded for the {{outcome}} measure chosen at the top. If there is only one score recorded, then this is what will be filtered on.

#### Earliest {{Outcome}} Score

You can specify here what you would like the earliest score to be using the options in the drop-down box. It could an exact number, at least, up to and including, or between two numbers.

#### {{Workarea}} of Earliest {{Outcome}}

If you want to, you can filter by {{outcome}}s scored against particular {{workarea}}s. This means that people who have a score for that {{outcome}} measure which is recorded against a different {{workarea}} will be excluded from the {{group}}.

### Latest {{Outcome}}

This section can be used to show {{people}} whose latest dated {{outcome}} score is in a particular range.  Used with 'Earliest {{outcome}} score' this can show change, or by itself to show {{people}} whose latest score as at a specific level.

#### Change in {{Outcome}} Score

Use this filter to find {{people}} whose scores for the {{outcome}} measure have changed over time. If you do not add any dates to the field at the top of the page, then {{Lamplight}} will compare the earliest and latest scores recorded.

#### Latest {{Outcome}} Score

Use the boxes here to filter for people whose last recorded {{outcome}} was an exact score, at least a specific score, up to and including the score or between specific scores. If you have added dates at the top of the page, then {{Lamplight}} will filter for the last score in that date range.

#### {{Workarea}} of Latest {{Outcome}}

You can filter by latest {{outcome}}s scored against specific {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}}s. This means that a {{person}} whose last score is recorded against a different {{workarea}} will be excluded from the {{group}}.


### Example: Number 1 - Who has seen positive change

The image below allows us to identify a {{group}} of {{people}} whose score for the 'I feel positive about my life' {{outcome}} went up at least one point between the start of Q1 2021 and the end of Q4 2022. No filter for {{workarea}} was selected, so it will be for anyone that's reposnded to the question irrespective of the {{workarea}} selected at point of data entry.

### Example: Number 2 - Who gained employment

Tip - It's helpful to know what the scores on your measures mean. This example is for a specific score, in this system 1 = yes, therefore the list is for all those who have answered yes to the 'have they gained employment' question.

### Example: Number 2 - Movement to an end result

You can use the settings on the page together. For example, the image below would tell us those who experienced at least 2 points of positive change and their latest score was at least 5. Tip - refer back to the timeframe you've included above as the movement in outcome scores must have taken place within the timeframe specified.
