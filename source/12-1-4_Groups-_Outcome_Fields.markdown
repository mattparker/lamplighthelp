# 12.1.4  <i class="fa fa-users"></i> {{Auto group}}s: {{Outcome}} Fields

> The '{{Outcome}} Fields' tab is where you can search for {{people}} based on their {{outcome}} scores, or changes in their scores, for a particular measure



You can look for {{people}} with a specific score, those who have changed over time or those who have maintained a score for a specified period of time. 

Bear in mind here that {{Lamplight}} treats yes-no {{outcome}}s as 1 - 0 (i.e. a 'yes' is stored as 1, and a 'no' as a 0), so to find {{people}} that have the answer 'yes' recorded against a specific {{outcome}} you'll need to enter the '{{Outcome}} score' as 'Equal to' '1'. 

### {{Outcome}}

To use {{Outcome}}s to filter your group, you must choose an individual measure from the '{{Outcome}}' drop-down box at the top of the page.  It is not possible to filter on more than one.

#### Date of {{Outcome}}(s)

You can limit the search to specific dates. (Options for date fields in the {{Outcome}} tab function the same as in the {{Work}} tab - for more on this see [12.1.3 {{Group}}s: {{Work}}, {{Referral}} and {{Grant}} Fields](/help/index/p/12.1.3). 
For example, you can find {{people}} who had their 'Confidence in a Group' {{outcome}} scored sometime before November 2018. (As the 'Date' option is 'On or before', the date entered in this case would be 31 October 2018).

#### Duration {{Outcome}} Score Maintained

The duration option gives you the chance to filter your list to show only people who had that {{outcome}} score for at least a given amount of time. Using the duration option will give you people that achieved that {{outcome}} and still had it (or there were no subsequent entries) within that time period. 

If you use the duration option without a date, {{Lamplight}} will use the latest {{outcome}} recorded as its reference point.


### Earliest or Any {{Outcome}}

This section relates to the earliest score recorded for the {{outcome}} measure chosen at the top. If there is only one score recorded, then this is what will be filtered on.

#### Earliest {{Outcome}} Score
You can specify here what you would like the earliest score to be using the options in the drop-down box. It could an exact number, at least, up to and including, or between two numbers.

#### {{Workarea}} of Earliest {{Outcome}}
If you want to, you can filter by {{outcome}}s scored against particular {{workarea}}s. This means that people who have a score for that {{outcome}} measure which is recorded against a different {{workarea}} will be excluded from the {{group}}.

### Latest {{Outcome}}

This section can be used to show {{people}} whose latest dated {{outcome}} score is in a particular range.  Used with 'Earliest {{outcome}} score' this can show change, or by itself to show {{people}} whose latest score as at a specific level.

#### Change in {{Outcome}} Score

Use this filter to find {{people}} whose scores for the {{outcome}} measure have changed over time. If you do not add any dates to the field at the top of the page, then {{Lamplight}} will compare the earliest and latest scores recorded.

#### Latest {{Outcome}} Score

Use the boxes here to filter for people whose last recorded {{outcome}} was an exact score, at least a specific score, up to and including the score or between specific scores. If you have added dates at the top of the page, then {{Lamplight}} will filter for the last score in that date range.

#### {{Workarea}} of Latest {{Outcome}}
You can filter by latest {{outcome}}s scored against specific {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}}s. This means that a {{person}} whose last score is recorded against a different {{workarea}} will be excluded from the {{group}}.


### Example

A {{group}} for {{people}} whose score for the 'Networks and Relationships' {{outcome}} went up at least one point between 1st January 2017 and 31st December 2018. This score was recorded against the 'Carer Respite' {{workarea}}.
