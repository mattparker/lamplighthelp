# 31.4.0 Creating a {{Recruiter}} campaign

> A {{recruiter}} campaign is used to seek applications for a particular post.  {{Recruiter_applicant}}s
> can create and edit their applications between the opening and closing dates. 

To create a new {{recruiter}} campaign, click {{people}} > {{recruiter}} > add new campaign.  You'll 
see a form to create the new campaign:

![Creating a {{recruiter}} campaign](31.4.0a.png)

The name of the position will usually be the job title, and will be visible to {{recruiter_applicant}}s.
Set the date range for the campaign - {{recruiter_applicant}}s will not be able to enter any data
outside of this date range.  Then, select the appropriate Question Set for the post.

You can select up to 10 fields for diversity monitoring.  These will be stored in Lamplight along with
contact details, but will not be visible to the shortlisting panel.  These fields should reflect your
own equalities policy.

You can also select a field to store 'where you heard about this role' from, which should be a text field.

## Shortlisting panel

Select the members of staff who will be involved in shortlisting.  Start typing their name in the 
search box, and click on it when the correct person appears.

Only these people will be able to score responses and view the scores given.

## Text and styling

The Introductory text appears at the top of the page that applicants see.  You can enter whatever you like,
perhaps linking back to information about the post and explaining the application process. 
In particular you may want to emphasize that applications will be anonymised and personal information
will not be visible to panel members.

You may also want to use these boxes for your privacy statement, or link to to it.

The Text to display at the bottom of the page is shown after the questions.

After the {{recruiter_applicant}} has saved their response, they will see a message including
the URL for their application, and which says that they have been emailed it.  You can add information
here if needed.

The remaining style options allow you to customise the page that applicants see.

## Email templates

After shortlisting you can email successful and unsuccessful applicants to invite them to interview
or give them the bad news.

These emails can be personalised using mail merge fields, and the unsuccessful template can include
a placeholder for feedback.  This takes the information from the 'reason' given in the shortlisting decision.

## Save the campaign

When you save the campaign you will see a summary of the details for it, including the URL for the campaign.
