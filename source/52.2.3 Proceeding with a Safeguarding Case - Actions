# 52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions

> {{Safeguarding}} actions are the things you do to process a {{safeguarding case}}. For example, adding a note of a meeting or updating the status of the {{safeguarding case}}.

Once a {{safeguarding case}} has been raised {{safeguarding lead contact}}s and {{safeguarding}} managers can carry out various 
actions on the {{safeguarding case}} to move it forwards. The actions available are dependent on the status of the {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Severity


The severity of a {{safeguarding case}} is an indication of the level of risk you judge the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} to be under. There
are five levels of severity,

  • Low
  • Low-Moderate
  • Moderate
  • Moderate-High
  • High

To change the severity of a {{safeguarding case}}:

1. Select the relevant severity level from the drop down 'Change Severity rating of Safeguarding case'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 1](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_1.png)

2. Click 'change severity'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 2](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_2.png)

The severity is displayed with an ! alongside the severity level and is colour coded. The redder it is the more severe it is.
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 3](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_3.png)

Severity is displayed in the following places:

1. On the {{safeguarding case}} listing page
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 4](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_4.png)

2. At the top of the {{safeguarding case}} detail page in the 'Key details' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 5](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_5.png)

3. On the dashboard
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 6](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_6.png)

It is only visible to {{Safeguarding}} Managers and {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s.

Any changes to severity are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. To view the log for each change to the severity of a
{{safeguarding case}}:

1. Scroll down to the 'Utilities' box in the {{safeguarding case}}
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 7](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_13.png)

2. Click the 'Toggle message display' button
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 8](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_14.png)

3. Underneath in the 'Case Notes and Actions' section you should now see a log of all changes to the {{safeguarding case}}, including the severity if this has been changed
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 9](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_15.png)

4. If you click the 'Toggle message display' button again this will hide the log, allowing you to toggle between making the log visible or not
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 10](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_16.png)

If you do make a change to the severity level you may also need to add a comment to explain the change (see below).


### <i class="fas fa-route"></i> Status


The status represents the status of the {{safeguarding case}}. By default these are:

1. New {{safeguarding case}} raised - this is the status when someone raises a new {{safeguarding case}}. You would not normally carry out any actions at this stage.

2. Internal fact gathering - when you assign a {{safeguarding lead contact}} you will also automatically set the status to 'Internal fact gathering'. Your initial actions will happen at this stage.

3. Preparing internal reports - after gathering initial facts you may need to prepare internal reports.

4. External investigation - for when the {{safeguarding case}} is passed to an external agency. 

5. Waiting for external reports - when you are waiting for reports from the external investigation.

6. Response following external reports - for when you have received a response following external reports.

7. Escalate concern - if you are unhappy with external responses you may wish to escalate your concern.

8. On-going issue - for {{safeguarding case}}s that are not resolved but also not under active investigation. This may be relevant when working with people who are the cause of {{safeguarding}} concerns.

9. Requires sign-off - a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will be notified by email and will need to review and sign-off the {{safeguarding case}}. 

10. Signed off - the final stages when outcomes and reviews of the process may be carried out.

11. Closed - the {{safeguarding case}} is no longer an active {{safeguarfing case}}.

To change the status of a {{safeguarding case}}: 

1. Select the new status from the drop down 'Change Status of Safeguarding case'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 11](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_7.png)

2. Click 'change status' 
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 12](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_8.png)

Status is displayed in the following places:

1. On the {{safeguarding case}} listing page
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 13](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_9.png)

2. At the top of the {{safeguarding case}} detail page in the 'Key details' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 14](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_10.png)

3. On the dashboard
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 15](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_11.png)

Changing the status also affects which actions are available.

Any changes to status are logged in the {{safeguarding case}} and can be viewed by following the same steps as described above in the severity section. You may need to also add a comment to explain changes. The system allows you
to go "backwards" in status but we would suggest that you add explanatory comments if you do so. 

Concerns that have 'Ongoing issue' or 'Closed' status will generally not be shown in the main {{safeguarding case}} listing page to make it easier
to manage current {{safeguarding case}}s. To include them in the listing you can use the filter function. For more information on how to use this
see [52.2.1 Viewing All Safeguarding Cases](/help/index/p/52.2.1).
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 16](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_12.png)


### <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i> View other {{safeguarding case}}s


Early in the process you may need to check whether the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} has had other {{safeguarding case}}s raised. You
may also need to know if others connected to that person have too. Knowing this will help you to establish whether the
{{safeguarding case}} that has been raised is part of a larger pattern that you should be aware of.

To view any {{safeguarding case}}s that may be relevant:

1. Scroll down to the 'Check for other concerns raised' box in the {{safeguarding case}}
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 17](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_17.png)

2. Click the 'View related {{safeguarding case}}s' button
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 18](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_18.png)

3. This will open a pop up window showing a table of any {{safeguarding case}}s that have been raised about the same person 
or about anyone with a relationship to this person

4. If there aren't any related {{safeguarding case}}s the pop up window will display the message 'No records found.'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 19](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_19.png)

5. If there are related {{safeguarding case}}s the table in the pop up window will list summary information about the {{safeguarding case}}s
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 20](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_20.png)

6. To review the related {{safeguarding case}}s more fully you will need to click on the name of the {{safeguarding case}} in the 'Summary of' column, which will open up the details available to you
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 21](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_21.png)

Note that if you are not a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or a {{safeguarding lead contact}} on the other {{safeguarding case}}s 
the information available to you may be quite limited. You may need to speak to a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or the relevant 
{{safeguarding lead contact}} in this situation.


### <i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Notes


Notes are detailed records of your work on the {{safeguarding case}}. They can be added by the {{safeguarding lead contact}} or by a {{Safeguarding}} 
Manager. To add a {{safeguarding}} note:

1. Scroll down to the 'Add {{safeguarding}} note' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 22](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_22.png)

2. Click the 'Add Note' button
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 23](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_23.png)

3. This will take you to a screen similar to adding work or other {{activity}} records. As with work or other {{activity}} records
you will notice there are multiple pages to complete. These are:
  
    • 'When and where' - you will need to select the relevant date/time for the 'Date information collected' and 
    'Date information recorded' fields (please note that if you do not change these they will default to the current date/time), the {{workarea}} and, if relevant, the location
    ![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 24](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_24.png)

    • 'Attendance' - you will need to add people or organisations that are relevant to this note using the search bar, for instance if it is a record of a meeting
    ![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 25](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_25.png)

    • 'Details' - you will need to add full text notes 
    ![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 26](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_26.png)

    • 'Media' - if you have the {{media module}} you can also upload any files that are relevant by clicking the 'Choose file' button. Please 
    note if you do add files to the {{safeguarding}} note the contents of the files won’t be visible directly in the {{safeguarding}} case detail screen and nor will they 
    be when you print the {{safeguarding}} case details. This may influence whether you attach the file or include the content in the text fields of the {{safeguarding}} note
    ![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 27](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_27.png)

4. Once all of the relevant information has been entered click the 'Save & view record' button in the right-hand top corner or the 'Save' button at the bottom of the note
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 28](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_28.png)
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 29](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_29.png)

5. If you are unable to save and have a button that says 'Can't save yet' you will need to select a {{workarea}} before you can save
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 30](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_30.png)

6. Once saved you will return to the main {{safeguarding case}} detail screen 

7. If you scroll down the {{safeguarding case}} to the 'Case Notes and Actions' section you will see the {{safeguarding}} note you have just created 
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 31](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_31.png)


### <i class="fas fa-comment-alt"> </i> Comments


Comments can be made throughout the processing of a {{safeguarding case}}. They are simple text notes that add
snippets of information to the investigation. Comments can be made on the {{safeguarding case}} overall or on 
particular {{safeguarding}} notes within the {{safeguarding case}}.

To add a comment to the {{safeguarding case}}:

1. Scroll down to the 'Add Comment' box

![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 39](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_40.png)

We see {{safeguarding}} notes as the detailed records of a {{safeguarding case}} and comments as post-its or scribbles in the margin.


### <i class="fas fa-comment-medical"></i> Shared Details

It may be necessary to provide some information to the rest of your organisation about the {{safeguarding case}} that has been raised
without providing full details. To do this:

1. Scroll down to the 'Add Shared Details for the team' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 40](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_41.png)

![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 43](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_44.png)

In a multiple {{project}} system you can choose whether the text is visible in all {{project}}s that the profile is visible in
or just the current one. Set this by ticking the checkbox below the shared details text box.

To change the shared text for a {{safeguarding case}} simply type the new text into the text box and save it. This will update the text. A
record of the changes is shown in the {{safeguarding case}} timeline in the 'Case Notes and Actions' section. 
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 44](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_45.png)

4. You can print directly or to pdf if needed

As well as the visual layout, the print view differs in that the "process" elements of the timeline (who did what when)
are separated from the substance bits, for example {{safeguarding}} notes and comments.


### <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> Toggle messages


As a {{safeguarding case}} proceeds the number of messages in the timeline will grow. If you need to hide them temporarily
to view the substance of comments and notes you can do this in the following way:

![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 69](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_69.png)
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 70](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_70.png)

Note only {{Safeguarding}} Managers can sign off a {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> Add Final Report


When a {{safeguarding case}} has reached 'Signed off' status you may wish to add a Final Report. This is a review of 
the {{safeguarding case}}, any lessons learned, or actions required for the organisation to improve its practice in the future. 
To add a Final Report:

1. Scroll down to the 'Add {{safeguarding}} final report' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 71](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_71.png)

![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 76](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_76.png)

These reports can also be viewed alongside other reports from other {{safeguarding case}}s. They should not include detailed information about the
{{safeguarding case}} itself but be focused on the process and any wider issues that the {{safeguarding case}} raised. To view all
