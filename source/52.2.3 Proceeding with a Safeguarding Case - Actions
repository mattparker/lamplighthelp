# 52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions

> {{Safeguarding}} actions are the things you do to process a {{safeguarding case}}. For example, adding a note of a meeting or updating the status of the {{safeguarding case}}.

Once a {{safeguarding case}} has been raised {{safeguarding lead contact}}s and {{safeguarding}} managers can carry out various 
actions on the {{safeguarding case}} to move it forwards. The actions available are dependent on the status of the {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Severity


The severity of a {{safeguarding case}} is an indication of the level of risk you judge the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} to be under. There
are five levels of severity,

  • Low
  • Low-Moderate
  • Moderate
  • Moderate-High
  • High

To change the severity of a {{safeguarding case}}:

1. Select the relevant severity level from the drop down 'Change Severity rating of Safeguarding case'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 1](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_1.png)

2. Click 'change severity'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 2](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_2.png)

The severity is displayed with an ! alongside the severity level and is colour coded. The redder it is the more severe it is.
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 3](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_3.png)

Severity is displayed in the following places:

1. On the {{safeguarding case}} listing page
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 4](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_4.png)

2. At the top of the {{safeguarding case}} detail page in the 'Key details' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 5](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_5.png)

3. On the dashboard
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 6](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_6.png)

It is only visible to {{Safeguarding}} Managers and {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s.

Any changes to severity are logged in the {{safeguarding case}}. To view the log for each change to the severity of a
{{safeguarding case}}:

1. Scroll down to the 'Utilities' box in the {{safeguarding case}}
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 7](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_13.png)

2. Click the 'Toggle message display' button
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 8](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_14.png)

3. Underneath in the 'Case Notes and Actions' section you should now see a log of all changes to the {{safeguarding case}}, including the severity if this has been changed
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 9](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_15.png)

4. If you click the 'Toggle message display' button again this will hide the log, allowing you to toggle between making the log visible or not
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 10](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_16.png)

If you do make a change to the severity level you may also need to add a comment to explain the change (see below).


### <i class="fas fa-route"></i> Status


The status represents the status of the {{safeguarding case}}. By default these are:

1. New {{safeguarding case}} raised - this is the status when someone raises a new {{safeguarding case}}. You would not normally carry out any actions at this stage.

2. Internal fact gathering - when you assign a {{safeguarding lead contact}} you will also automatically set the status to 'Internal fact gathering'. Your initial actions will happen at this stage.

3. Preparing internal reports - after gathering initial facts you may need to prepare internal reports.

4. External investigation - for when the {{safeguarding case}} is passed to an external agency. 

5. Waiting for external reports - when you are waiting for reports from the external investigation.

6. Response following external reports - for when you have received a response following external reports.

7. Escalate concern - if you are unhappy with external responses you may wish to escalate your concern.

8. On-going issue - for {{safeguarding case}}s that are not resolved but also not under active investigation. This may be relevant when working with people who are the cause of {{safeguarding}} concerns.

9. Requires sign-off - a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will be notified by email and will need to review and sign-off the {{safeguarding case}}. 

10. Signed off - the final stages when outcomes and reviews of the process may be carried out.

11. Closed - the {{safeguarding case}} is no longer an active {{safeguarfing case}}.

To change the status of a {{safeguarding case}}: 

1. Select the new status from the drop down 'Change Status of Safeguarding case'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 11](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_7.png)

2. Click 'change status' 
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 12](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_8.png)

Status is displayed in the following places:

1. On the {{safeguarding case}} listing page
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 13](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_9.png)

2. At the top of the {{safeguarding case}} detail page in the 'Key details' box
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 14](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_10.png)

3. On the dashboard
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 15](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_11.png)

Changing the status also affects which actions are available.

Any changes to status are logged in the {{safeguarding case}} and can be viewed by following the same steps as described above in the severity section. You may need to also add a comment to explain changes. The system allows you
to go "backwards" in status but we would suggest that you add explanatory comments if you do so. 

Concerns that have 'Ongoing issue' or 'Closed' status will generally not be shown in the main {{safeguarding case}} listing page to make it easier
to manage current {{safeguarding case}}s. To include them in the listing you can use the filter function. For more information on how to use this
see [52.2.1 Viewing All Safeguarding Cases](/help/index/p/52.2.1).
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 16](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_12.png)


### <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i> View other {{safeguarding case}}s


Early in the process you may need to check whether the subject of the {{safeguarding case}} has had other {{safeguarding case}}s raised. You
may also need to know if others connected to that person have too. Knowing this will help you to establish whether the
{{safeguarding case}} that has been raised is part of a larger pattern that you should be aware of.

To view any {{safeguarding case}}s that may be relevant:

1. Scroll down to the 'Check for other concerns raised' box in the {{safeguarding case}}
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 17](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_17.png)

2. Click the 'View related {{safeguarding case}}s' button
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 18](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_18.png)

3. This will open a pop up window showing a table of any {{safeguarding case}}s that have been raised about the same person 
or about anyone with a relationship to this person

4. If there aren't any related {{safeguarding case}}s the pop up window will display the message 'No records found.'
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 19](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_19.png)

5. If there are related {{safeguarding case}}s the table in the pop up window will list summary information about the {{safeguarding case}}s
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 20](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_20.png)

6. To review the related {{safeguarding case}}s more fully you will need to click on the name of the {{safeguarding case}} in the 'Summary of' column, which will open up the details available to you
![52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions - step 21](52.2.3_Proceeding_with_a_Safeguarding_Case_-_Actions_im_21.png)

Note that if you are not a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or a {{safeguarding lead contact}} on the other {{safeguarding case}}s 
the information available to you may be quite limited. You may need to speak to a {{Safeguarding}} Manager or the relevant 
{{safeguarding lead contact}} in this situation.

******UP TO HERE*******

### <i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Notes

Notes are detailed records of your work on the {{safeguarding case}}. They can be added by the {{safeguarding lead contact}} or by a {{Safeguarding}} 
Manager. To add a case note click the button in the main action panel.

This will take you to a screen similar to adding work or other {{activity}} records. As with them, select the {{workarea}},
location if relevant, and, if others were involved, their names in the involving tab. Full text notes can then be added
in the details tab.

If you have the media module on your system you can add files to case notes. If you do so, the contents of the files
won’t be visible directly in the main concern detail screen, and nor will they be when you print the concern details.
This may influence whether you attach the file or include the content in the text fields of the Note.

When you click save you will return to the main concern detail screen, with the Note you have just created at the
bottom of the listing, as records are shown in date order of when they were added.


### <i class="fas fa-comment-alt"> </i> Comments

Comments can be made throughout the processing of a {{safeguarding case}}.  They are simple text notes that add
snippets of information to the investigation.  Comments can be made on particular notes within the investigation, on or 
the concern overall.

To add a comment to the concern, type your text in the main action panel and click save. You will see the comment in the
main timeline.

To add a comment to an existing Note, type your text in the box that immediately follows the note details.

We see Notes as the detailed records of a {{safeguarding case}}, and Comments as post-its or scribbles in the margin.


### <i class="fas fa-comment-medical"></i> Shared text

It may be necessary to provide some information to the rest of your organisation about the {{safeguarding case}} that has been raised,
without providing full details. To do this, you can add text in the 'Add Shared Details for the team' box. 
When you do this, the date of the incident and text you have entered will be shown in the profile header area when viewing that profile.

In a multiple {{project}} system, you can choose whether the text is visible in all {{project}}s that the profile is visible in,
or just the current one. Set this by ticking the checkbox below the comment text.

To change the shared text for a {{safeguarding case}}, simply type the new text into the text box and save it. This will update the text. A
record of the changes is shown in the {{safeguarding case}} timeline.


### <i class="fas fa-print"></i> Print

A print view of the concern is available that splits the {{safeguarding case}} into sections, and provides the same controls available
when printing profiles. A new tab will open showing all the details of the {{safeguarding case}}. You can print directly, or to pdf if
needed.

As well as the visual layout, the print view differs in that the "process" elements of the timeline (who did what when)
are separated from the substance bits - Notes and Comments.


### <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> Toggle messages

As a {{safeguarding case}} proceeds the number of messages in the timeline will grow. If you need to hide them temporarily
to view the substance of Comments and Notes, click the 'Toggle messages button'. System messages, about changes to the
{{safeguarding case}}, are temporarily hidden. Click the button again to view them.

Your system administrator can change whether these messages are initially displayed in a {{safeguarding case}}.

### <i class="fas fa-link"></i> Copy URL

Click this to copy the URL (web address) of the current {{safeguarding case}} to your clipboard so you can paste
it as a reference elsewhere. (Ctrl-v is keyboard shortcut for paste).

### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Edit other information

Some custom fields may be editable, depending on the settings for any custom
fields you have set up and the current status of the {{safeguarding case}}. 
To make any changes, click the 'edit custom fields' button. An edit form will open showing any fields that may be changed.

All changes to these fields are logged within the concern timeline.


### <i class="far fa-envelope"></i> Notify a colleague

If you need to involve a colleague in a {{safeguarding case}} you can notify them about it as an action. Lamplight will send
them an email with your message and a link to the {{safeguarding case}}. This will also be logged within the {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="fas fa-pen-fancy"></i> Set to Sign off

You may require a {{safeguarding}} Manager to sign off a concern before it is closed. To assign it to a {{Safeguarding}} 
manager, change the status and click save. {{Safeguarding}} managers will receive an email notification asking them to review
and close the concern.

You will now see that most actions are locked to {{safeguarding lead contact}}s. A {{Safeguarding}} Manager will now need to review the
concern and sign it off.

### <i class="fas fa-pen-fancy"></i> Sign off

A {{Safeguarding}} Manager will see the 'Sign Off' action. To do so, add any final text the {{Safeguarding}} Manager wants to add
and click the save button. This will add the final comment and change the status of the {{safeguarding case}} to 'Signed off'. Only 
{{Safeguarding}}  Managers can sign off a {{safeguarding case}}.


### <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> Add Final Report

When a {{safeguarding case}} has reached 'Signed off' status, you may wish to add a Final Report. This is a review of the {{safeguarding case}}, any lessons
learned, or actions required for the organisation to improve your practice in the future. 
To add a Final Report click the 'Add Final Report' button and complete the details as needed.

These records can be viewed alongside others from other {{safeguarding case}}s. They should not include detailed information about the
{{safeguarding case}} itself, but be focused on the process and any wider issues that the {{safeguarding case}} raised.

### Closing a {{safeguarding case}}

To close a {{safeguarding case}}, simply update the status to Closed.

### <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Change closure outcome of {{safeguarding case}}

There are built-in facility to record the final outcome of a {{safeguarding case}} from a drop down list. Your
system administrator will set these up if they are required.

### <i class="fas fa-archive"></i> Archiving a {{safeguarding case}}

If a {{safeguarding case}} has been raised in genuine error then you may wish to archive it.
There is space to add a comment explaining why (for example two were created, or it was linked to the wrong profile).
Generally {{safeguarding case}}s should be closed, rather than archived.
