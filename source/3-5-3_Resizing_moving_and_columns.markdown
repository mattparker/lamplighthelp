# 3.5.3 Resizing and Selecting Columns

> You can change the way a table looks by changing the size of columns, and show or hide different columns

### Resizing Columns

All columns can be resized. On the column headers, hover over the dividing line between one column and the next. You will see the cursor change to a left-right resize icon:

Click and drag the column to change its width. 

### Selecting Columns to View

Many tables in {{Lamplight}} have columns which are hidden. When you right click on the coloured header row of the table you will see a list of all the available columns you can view. You can tick and untick by each one (you will need to do this one at a time) to choose the information you would like to view in your table. This enables you to select appropriate information to download if required (see section [3.5.4  Downloading tables](/help/index/p/3.5.4)).

You can also save the columns that you have chosen so that each time you come back to this table it will automatically show the same layout. To do this, right click on the coloured header row, and at the bottom of the menu choose 'Save table columns layout'.
