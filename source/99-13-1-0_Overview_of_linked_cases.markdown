# 13.1.0    Overview of {{linked case}}s

> {{Linked case}}s link different kinds of record ({{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{comm}}s etc) together, and allow you a different range of reporting options across the {{Linked case}} as a whole. 

{{Linked case}}s are a way of organising records within {{Lamplight}}. One person may have several {{linked case}}s; each {{linked case}} may involve several different people. There is a lot of flexibility so you can use them in the way that suits your way of working.

Using the options in the case, you may be able to select different types of cases, or record information, such as why the case has closed.

In most systems that uses {{Linked case}}'s, you'll find details of a {{person}}'s {Linked case}}'s in the '{{linked case}} View' tab in their profile.  (Your system may use a different name to the one in the image below)

__Using {{Linked case}}'s__

You can link many different types of record to a case.  For example, one {{linked case}} may consist of 4 {{work}} records; some {{outcome}} measures; and a couple of {{comm}}s (if you have the {{comm}}s module)  You can do this, either by creating the record from within the {{linked case}} View tab, or by linking a record afterwards.

To create a record from within the {{Linked case}} View tab, goto a profile, and click on the {{Linked case}} View tab.  As shown below, from here you can choose the type of record to create.  Click on the appropriate button, and create the record as you would normally.

Alternatively you can link a record to a case by creating the record normally, and viewing them in the record view, and then using the option on the right click context menu, or menu link on the left of each row, to link to the case.  You can also do this with existing records.  Details shown in the next page.

{{Linked case}}s may be open or closed. You can only link records to open {{linked case}}s.
