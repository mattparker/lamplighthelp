# 4.9.0    Search boxes

> When adding details of {{people}} to records, {{Lamplight}} uses search-as- you-type. Click on the name when you see the {{person}} you need to add. 

Search boxes search as you type. You will see a drop-down list of matches appear as you start to type in a name:

![Search as you type]({{imgpath}}27a.png)

Click on the name that you require as soon as it appears.
