{{Lamplight}} has the following permission levels for database operators that control what they may see and do. Some of these options will depend on your system configuration.


* **Receptionist:** intended for occasional or low level staff. Operators can add and edit their own records. Within profiles they are only able to view the contact details, relationships, {{work}} records and {{eval}}s tabs. They are unable to work with {{group}}s, {{outcome}}s, {{comm}}s or run {{report}}s.
* **Data entry:** intended for basic data entry use. Operators can add {{user}}s and {{work}} records, but may only view and edit records they have created. They cannot create {{group}}s or {{comm}}s, or delete data.
* **Staff:** intended for general staff members. Operators are able to do everything that 'data entry' operators can, and in addition can create {{comm}}s, view {{report}}s, work with {{group}}s, and create Excel exports.
* **Manager:** can do everything that '{{Staff}}' operators can, and additionally can delete activity records.
* **System administrator:** has full privileges, in particular to the admin functions [18.0.0  System Administration](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.0.0) This means they can create new database operators and change various settings as described in this chapter.
* **Reporting:** has full access to the {{report}}s in the system, but cannot view or edit any other information.
* **{{Project}} Admin (where applicable):** has full system admin access as well as management of {{project}}s where a system has more than one.
