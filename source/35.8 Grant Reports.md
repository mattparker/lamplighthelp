# 35.8 Grant Reports

With {{grant}} {{report}}s you can find information on the total, average value and number of {{grant}}s received in a specific time period

If you are using {{grant}} records in your system you can report on amounts received in time periods that you specify. You can present this {{report}} using {{workarea}}s or {{grant}} type, for example.

1. To run a {{grant}} report,  click on &#039;Reports&#039; on the main menu at the top of the screen

![35.8 {{Grant}} {{Report}}s - step 1](35.8_Grant_Reports_im_1.png)

From {{grant}} {{report}} box, you have option of what to choose.

- You can create your own {{grant}} {{report}}, based on your own criteria. When you have run the {{report}}, you can save the data, and the {{report}} will close.
- You can run a {{report}} template. This is a {{report}} with the criteria pre-determined and set-up to be run whenever you want. Dates for {{report}} templates can be dynamic, for example, they will always show the previous quarter from when you run the {{report}}. Once you've run a {{report}} template you can change the criteria and presentation to show different results at that moment, without changing the template itself.
- If you are a System Adminstrator you'll also see the option to set-up new {{report}} templates.

2. In the {{Grant}}s {{report}} section click on &#039;New {{grant}} {{report}} using your own criteria&#039;.

5. Select the filters you would like included in your {{report}}

Most of the filters are the same as for other {{report}}s [see 14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1). At the bottom you have the '{{Grant}} type' filter, which is specific to the {{grant}} {{report}}. The options that you see in the drop-down list will be specific to your system.

### Additional Filters

- If you have any custom fields in your {{grant}} records you will see any that can be used as filters in the 'Additional filters' tab. You can use these to narrow down the information that is included in your {{report}}.

### {{Report}} Presentation

6. Click on &#039;Report presentation&#039; and choose how to display your data

#### Row Data

Choose what information you want to be in the rows of the {{report}} from this drop-down box. This includes fields from your {{grant}} records, such as {{workarea}}, {{grant}} type or custom fields, as well as demographic details from the funders' profiles. For example, you might choose to show the information split up by the {{workarea}} it was linked to.

#### Column Data and Data to Show

You can also choose what information to show in your columns. For example, you may want to show how much was received from each {{grant}} type against your different {{workarea}}s. If you do this, you have to decide what type of data the {{report}} is showing:
  - Total value: the combined amount of the {{grant}}s.
  - Mean value: the mean average amount of the {{grant}}.
  - Number of {{grant}}s: how many grants recorded in the time specified.
