# 28.1 Starting a New {{auto group}}

**An {{auto group}} allows you to choose criteria to search for specific {{people}} or {{org}}s. If they match the criteria you specify, they will automatically be included in the {{group}}.**


It is important to know the filters you want, and not to add more than you need, to ensure your {{group}} consists of those you're interested in. Once you have finished choosing filters, your {{group}} will include {{people}} or {{org}}s that meet **ALL** the criteria you have entered (not some).

### To set up a new {{auto group}}:

1. From the top menu bar on the homepage select {{Group}}s

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 1](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_1.png)

2. Click the add button

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 2](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_2.png)

3. Click on add {{auto group}} from the pop up menu

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 3](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_3.png)

4. Click in the {{Group}} name box and choose a name for your {{group}}

The {{group}} name and a description are compulsory - you can't save your choices without filling these in.  Please note you can only use alphanumeric characters for this.
 - Choose something that makes it clear who your {{group}} is made up of - you will not be the only person able to use it.

5. Click on {{Group}} description box and enter a description for your {{group}}

- If you use this {{group}} for a specific purpose, such as quarterly reporting or for a particular funder, you can make a note of this in the '{{Group}} description' field to make it easier to find and for colleagues to understand.

6. You can lock a {{group}} for editing by checking the 'Lock this {{group}} for editing box'. If you do this only you and system admins will be able to edit this {{group}}. If it is important that you know the criteria must stay the same, for example when creating a {{group}} for regular reporting, then we would recommend you choose this option.

7. Click on the {{People}} or {{org}}s tab at the top of the box

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 7](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_7.png)

8. Select what kind of profile to include in the {{group}}. You can choose either {{person}} or {{org}}. If you need more than one of these types, you can create a {{group}} for each and them merge them (see [29.2 Creating A Merge {{Group}}](/help/index/p/29.2) for more details). 

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 8](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_8.png)

9. Select one or more roles for the profiles you want to include. If you don’t choose any then all roles for the profile type you’ve chosen ({{person}} or {{org}}) will be returned

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 9](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_9.png)

10. If you want to filter your {{group}} so that it returns specific names, click on Profile name search and enter your search terms. For example, if you wanted a {{group}} for all profiles with the same surname.

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 10](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_10.png)

11. You have the option to search in the following ways by name
a. Exact match - Will look to match the search term exactly.
b. Match anywhere - Will match the search term anywhere in the profile name.
c. Starts like - Match to profile names that start with the search term.
d. Is empty - Will show results where the profile name is empty.

12. You can create an auto {{group}} based on the date the profile was created in Lamplight. To confirm, this is NOT based on a dated record, such as referral or session attendance. You have the following options here:

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 11](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_11.png)

a. On or after - Will show profiles created on or after a specific date
b. On or before - Will show profiles created on or before a specific date
c. On - Will show profiles created on a specific date
d. Between - Will show profiles created between two specific dates

13. You can create an auto {{group}} of profiles that have ‘retained until’ dates, as per the dates added to the 'Contact details' tab in the profile (often used to support GDPR compliance). The date options for this are the same as for the ‘Date profile created’ field.

![28.1 Starting A New {{Group}} - step 12](28.1 Starting_A_New_List_im_12.png)

14. Click on the Visibility (current or archived) dropdown to choose either current or archived profiles. You can’t have both in one {{group}}. This allows you to choose whether your {{auto group}} will be made up of people who are active on your system (when you search for their profile it appears), or those who have been archived (see [108.2 Archiving Profiles](/help/index/p/108.2) for more details on archiving profiles). You cannot mix current and archived profiles in the same {{auto group}} (see [29.2 Creating A Merge {{Group}}](/help/index/p/29.2) for more details).
