# 12.1.2    {{Comm}} recipients

> Who do you want to send the {{comm}} to? Enter individual names, or the name of a {{group}}. 

In the recipients tab add the {{people}} you wish to send the {{comm}} to. These are added in the same way that you add attendees to {{work}} records: see section [9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2) for more help.

You can use relationships in {{comm}}s, if your administrator has set it up. For some types of relationship ('employee', for example), you may wish to address your {{comm}} to the individual but use their {{work}} address, which is stored in the linked profile (their employers). If this is enabled, you'll see both the individuals name in the search box, as well as any other links to other {{people}} that you can use.

The system will use the address details of the first named profile (in the example above the address for Lamplight) but would allow us to use personal details for the individual (for example Dear Matthew). If you wished to use the individuals' address details, start typing the individuals name in the search as you type bar first and choose individual linked to the organisation. 

Some relationships may need to be 'allowed' to be used in your {{comm}}s. Your system administrator can alter these settings via the Admin menu under 'relation types between {{people}}' see section [18.2.3  System Administration - relationships](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.3) for more information. 

If you are creating a letter or mailing labels, the system will add a copy of the message content for each recipient, so that any mail-merge fields can be included. This means that if your letter is one page long, and you're sending it to 10 people, the document produced will be 10 pages long.
