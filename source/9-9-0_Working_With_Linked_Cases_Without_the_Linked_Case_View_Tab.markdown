# 9.9.0 <i class="fas fa-link"></i> Working With {{Linked Case}}s Without the {{Linked Case}} View Tab

> If your organisation uses {{linked case}}s, it is possible to work with them even if you do not have a {{linked case}} view tab in profiles



When you are viewing {{activity}} records ({{work}}, {{outcome}}s etc.):

- Find a record already linked to the relevant {{linked case}}. This could be in a profile's '{{Work}} records' tab, for example. 
- To find a do this you will need a column in the table which gives {{linked case}} information, such as '{{Linked case}} name. If you can't see any {{linked case}} details in the table, right click on the top header bar of the table to show the list of columns available, and tick '{{Linked case}} name'.
- Right-click on the record to open the menu.

### Context Menu {{Linked Case}} Options
Some of these options will be greyed out so that you can't choose them. For example, if a record is not already linked to a {{linked case}}, then you will not be able to remove one, or close the one it is associated with. Each record can only be attached to one {{linked case}}.

- Link to {{linked case}}: you can link this record to a {{linked case}} if it is not already linked to another one. If it is already linked then the option will be greyed-out. 
- Follow-up {{linked case}}: opens a duplicate record for you to edit, which will automatically save into to the same {{linked case}}.
- Remove link to {{linked case}}: removes this record from the {{linked case}} it was attached to.
- Close {{linked case}}: closes the {{linked case}} that the record was linked to. If closing this way, you will not have the chance to edit it or change the date. It will be recorded as closing on today's date.
- Re-open {{linked case}}: allows you to the {{linked case}} that the record is attached to if it was previously closed.
- View {{linked case}} details: opens to show you the details of the {{linked case}} as well as all the records which are linked to it.
- Edit {{linked case}}: opens an editing form where you can change the details (name, description etc.) of the {{linked case}}.
- It is not possible to delete {{linked case}}s from here.

The System Administrator can choose to show a '{{Linked case}} view' tab on profiles. For more on that see [16.12.3 Global Settings: {{Linked Case}}s](/help/index/p/16.12.3).
If {{linked case}}s are enabled on your system but you still do not see that tab in profiles, see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2)) where you can select to view it.
