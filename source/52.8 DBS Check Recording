# 52.8 DBS Check Recording

> You can record details of DBS checks carried out and receive reminders when renewals are due.

The application and results of DBS checks can be recorded in individual profiles. You will need to make sure that:

1. The profile is the correct type 
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 1](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_1.png)

2. Your system admins have made the DBS profile tab visible in system admin (for more information on how to do this see [103 Creating and Editing Operator templates](/help/index/p/103))
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 2](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_2.png)

In the profile tab you will see a table listing all the DBS checks carried out. To add a new one:

1. Click the 'add' button
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 3](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_3.png)

2. This will open a page similar to other {{activity}} {{record}}s 

3. The first tab you come to is 'Check details', you will need to fill in the following details:

  - 'Date DBS process started' (if you do not edit this field it will default to the date/time at the point of creating the {{record}})
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 4](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_4.png)
  - 'Who is the check for'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 5](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_5.png)
  - 'Status of check'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 6](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_6.png)
  - 'Date DBS check received' (this is a required field and will need to be filled in before the record can be saved)
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 7](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_7.png)
  - 'Certificate reference number'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 8](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_8.png)
  - 'Is the DBS check accepted?'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 9](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_9.png)
  - 'Notes on check'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 10](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_10.png)
  - 'Is the check renewable?'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 11](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_11.png)
  - 'Confirm Disclosure has been scanned'
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 12](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_12.png)
  - 'Expiry date' - this will be used to create lists of staff with expired DBS checks, for more on this 
  see [52.5 {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard](/help/index/p/52.5) (if you do not edit this field it will default 
  to five years from the date at the point of creating the {{record}})
  ![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 13](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_13.png)

These details do not need to be filled in all at once but rather you should fill in the details that you know. You may complete this 
initially when applying and then edit it when the results are returned.

4. If you have the {{Media}} Module you will also be able to upload documents using the 'Media' tab
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 14](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_14.png)
