# 52.8 DBS Check Recording

> You can record details of DBS checks carried out and receive reminders when renewals are due.

The application and results of DBS checks can be recorded in individual profiles. You will need to make sure that:

1. The profile is the correct type 
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 1](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_1.png)

2. Your system admins have made the DBS profile tab visible in system admin (for more information on how to do this see [103 Creating and Editing Operator templates](/help/index/p/103))
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 2](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_2.png)

In the profile tab you will see a listing of all DBS checks carried out. To add a new one:

1. Click the 'add' button
![52.8 DBS Check Recording - step 3](52.8_DBS_Check_Recording_im_3.png)

2. This will open a page similar to other {{activity}} {{record}}s 

3. The first tab you come to is 'Check details', you will need to fill in the following details:

  - 'Date DBS process started' (if you do not edit this field it will default to the date/time at the point of creating the {{record}})
  - 'Who is the check for'
  - 'Status of check'
  - 'Date DBS check received' (this is a required field and will need to be filled in before the record can be saved)
  - 'Certificate reference number'
  - 'Is the DBS check accepted?'
  - 'Notes on check'
  - 'Is the check renewable?'
  - 'Confirm Disclosure has been scanned'
  - 'Expiry date' - this will be used to create lists of staff with expired DBS checks, for more on this 
  see [52.5 {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard](/help/index/p/52.5) (if you do not edit this field it will default 
  to five years from the date at the point of creating the {{record}})

These details do not need to be filled in all at once but rather you should fill in the details that you know. You may complete this 
initially when applying and then edit it when the results are returned.

4. If you have the {{Media}} Module you will also be able to upload documents using the 'Media' tab

5. Click 'save' when you are done

**** UP TO HERE **** AND PUT IMAGES IN ABOVE (ALREADY SAVED ETC)

To edit an existing record:

1. Right click the DBS check from the profile listing

2. Select 'edit' from the popup menu

### Who can view DBS records?

{{Safeguarding}} Managers can view all DBS records. You can also assign operators to have access to DBS records without
providing them with full access to {{safeguarding case}}s.  To do so, edit their database operator profile (admin > 
system administration > Manage database operators) and tick the 'Give this operator access to DBS records?' box.


### {{Safeguarding}} / DBS Home Page Tab

Operators at Manager level and above may view DBS checks to the home page. This tab lists newly raised 
{{safeguarding case}}s and DBS Checks that expire within the next month (or other period set in global settings).

### {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard

A DBS status summary can be viewed on the {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard. This lists profiles that have expiring DBS checks,
and also profiles that don't have one at all.

### All DBS Checks Carried out

A list of all DBS checks can be viewed via the system admin menu. Go to Admin > System Administration on the main menu.
Then 'View all DBS Check records' in 'Database Operators And Security'. To see all profiles and their DBS status, click 
'View list of profiles and their DBS Check status' in the same place.
