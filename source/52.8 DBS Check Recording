### Who can view DBS records?

{{Safeguarding}} Managers can view all DBS records. You can also assign operators to have access to DBS records without
providing them with full access to {{safeguarding case}}s.  To do so, edit their database operator profile (admin > 
system administration > Manage database operators) and tick the 'Give this operator access to DBS records?' box.


### {{Safeguarding}} / DBS Home Page Tab

Operators at Manager level and above may view DBS checks to the home page. This tab lists newly raised 
{{safeguarding case}}s and DBS Checks that expire within the next month (or other period set in global settings).

### {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard

A DBS status summary can be viewed on the {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard. This lists profiles that have expiring DBS checks,
and also profiles that don't have one at all.

### All DBS Checks Carried out

A list of all DBS checks can be viewed via the system admin menu. Go to Admin > System Administration on the main menu.
Then 'View all DBS Check records' in 'Database Operators And Security'. To see all profiles and their DBS status, click 
'View list of profiles and their DBS Check status' in the same place.
