# 16.9.0 Creating {{Group}} / {{Group}} Data View Report Templates

> A {{group}} / {{group}} data view template allows you to quickly run a particular {{group}} and {{group}} data view

If you often need to see the same information about the same {{group}} of profiles, you can set up a template to 
run it in a single click. Templates are shortcuts to [using {{group}} data views with {{group}}s](/help/index/p/13.2.1).

You'll need to be a System Administrator to create templates.


### To Create a {{Group}} Template

You'll need to [create the {{group}}](/help/index/p/12.0.0) and [{{group}} data view](/help/index/p/13.0.0) you want to use first.
Once you have done so, go to 'admin -> system administration -> Templates -> 'Manage {{group}} and data view templates'.

- Once on this page, you will see existing templates, with options to edit or delete, and an 'add' button at the bottom.

### Completing the Template

The first page of the template is where you give the template a name, and a description, so that staff will know what 
it is designed to do.  We encourage you to be as specific as possible.

The name of the report will appear in the main menu list, and the description will show if you hover over it. They will be listed
alphabetically, so you may want to consider using a system to make sure they appear in groups and the best order for you.

You can also lock the report so that only you can edit it on this page.

The next page is '{{Group}} and data view'. Simply select the {{group}} and data view you want to use.
Note that if you change the definitions of either through the system, the template will update too.

If you have the [Reporting CodeSets module](/help/index/p/32.0.0) available you can also select one here. CodeSets 'translate' the data and headings in 
tables to match it to external systems, without actually changing any of your data.

Save your template. When you next reload the page (press F5) you will see your templates under '{{group}}s > view' on the 
main menu. Click the name of the template to jump straight to the data.
