> {{Referral}} {{report}}s allow you to count and summarise {{referral}}s within the timeframe you set




{{Referral}} {{report}}s collate information from your {{referral}} records. You can also use data from fields in profiles to show the results in different ways. (For more on {{report}} presentation, see [14.1.4 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/14.1.4)). 

### Running a {{Report}}

To run a {{referral}} {{report}}:

- On the main menu click '{{report}}s -> more -> {{referral}} {{report}}'.
- You will come to the '{{Report}} filters' screen:

![{{Referral}} {{report}} results](13.5.0a.png)

Most of the filters are the same as for other reports (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)).  At the bottom you have filters for {{referral}} success and direction. The options within them will vary as they are lists which have been customised for your system to reflect the information you capture in {{referral}} records. If you do not choose anything from these fields, then your {{report}} will return information from records whatever their success or direction.


### {{Report}} Presentation

You can use the options here to change the way in which your data is presented. For more on this see [14.1.4 {{Report}} Presentation](/help/index/p/14.1.4).


### The {{Report}} Results

Your {{report}} table will show:

![{{Referral}} {{Report}} table](13.5.0c.png)

- Number of {{referral}}s. This is the number of {{referral}} records between the dates selected.
- Number of {{people}} involved in {{referral}}s. This will show you the number of {{people}} in the attendance tables of these {{referral}} records. This will be affected by the 'Role' filter - if you have just chosen {{staff}}, for example, the number will relate only to the {{staff}} in those records.
- Number of different {{people}}. These are the unique individuals. If the same {{person}} has attended three separate {{referral}}s, they will be counted all three times in the 'Number of {{referral}}s' column, but only once in 'Number of different {{people}}.
