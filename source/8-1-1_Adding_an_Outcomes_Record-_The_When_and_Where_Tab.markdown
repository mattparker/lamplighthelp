# 8.1.1 <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Adding an {{Outcome}}s Record: The When and Where Tab

> The ''When and where' tab in an {{outcome}} record is where you can enter details of when the {{outcome}} was measured and what {{workarea}} it relates to



The date and {{workarea}} fields on the when and where tab are required. Many organisations will be able to simply ignore the time for the purposes of outcome records.

You must select one {{workarea}}, and you can choose any number of {{subworkarea}}s. 

![Adding an {{outcome}} record {{workarea}}- when and where](8.1.1a.png)

The {{subworkarea}}s for the {{workarea}} you have chosen will appear to the right hand side. 

You can select as many locations as necessary or none. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect.
