# 8.10.0    {{Group}}s tab

> The {{group}}s tab shows which {{group}}s a {{person}} belongs to. 

This tab shows the {{group}}s that the {{person}} is part of. (See section [14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0) for more on {{group}}s).

The table shows the name of the {{group}}, the {{group}} description, how many people are in the {{group}} and what type of {{group}} it is (auto, manual or merge).

Right clicking or using the menu button on the table will give you a range of options:

  * View full details - allows you to view the {{group}} using a {{group}} data view (see section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0) ). This will open in the main window.
  * Quick view in popup - lets you view the names of other members of the {{group}}.
  * Edit - will let you edit the {{group}} definition.
  * Delete - will delete the entire {{group}}.
  * {{Comm}} - takes you to the {{Comm}}s screen, with all members of the {{group}} listed as recipients of the {{comm}} (see section [12.0.0  {{Comm}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.0.0)). 
  * Print - will open a new tab in your browser where you can print the profiles of all the members of the group

{{Auto group}}s are based on a set of search criteria, and each time the {{group}} is used, {{Lamplight}} re-runs the search and updates the {{group}} membership. This is stored until the next time the {{group}} is used. However, when you view {{group}} membership on a profile tab, {{Lamplight}} uses the stored memberships - it does not re-check every {{group}} - it would take too long. This means that membership of {{auto group}}s is as of the last time the {{group}} was actually used. To refresh the membership of an {{auto group}}, you need to use the 'quick view in popup' or similar function to force the system to re-run the searches.
