# 16.12.3 Global Settings: {{Linked Case}}s

> {{Linked case}}s in Lamplight are a way to link different pieces of work. This tab affects whether you see them in your system, and some settings for them

**Do you want to use {{linked case}}s at all?**

{{Linked case}}s in Lamplight are a way to link different pieces of work. A {{linked case}} has a name, description and start and end dates. There are also three types of category that can be used to label {{linked case}}, and these can be specified in the System Administration menu depending on your needs. Any type of record or communication (if you have the communications module) can be added to a {{linked case}}, as well as records pertaining to different {{workareas}}.  

For example, a {{linked case}} could contain a referral record, initial evaluation forms, baseline outcome measures, and records of each meeting or group session, including the ones scheduled for the future. At the end of the {{linked case}}, it could be linked to final evaluation forms and closing outcome measures and contain the record of an onward referral before being given a closing date. It could exclude records that did not pertain specifically to the {{linked case}} in question, for example if the individual accessed a separate service during the period.
{{Linked case}}s can usefully identify which people are currently receiving a service. They can also make it easy to view which {{work}} records pertain to a particular subject or referral. There can be multiple {{linked case}}s open at once for each service user. Existing records can be linked to {{linked case}}s, and records can be unlinked as well.

The options for this tab are below:

- **Do you want to be able to set open dates of {{linked case}}s manually?**

   By default, this option is enabled, allowing the start date of {{linked case}}s to be specified, much like it is in {{work}} records. If you always want the start date of the {{linked case}} to be when it was entered onto the system, or if it is not important for your service to record a start date for a {{linked case}}, disabling this option will make data entry simpler when opening {{linked case}}s.
- **Do you want the {{linked case}} tab on profiles?**

   The ‘{{linked case}} view’ tab on profiles allows you to see any {{linked case}}s (active or inactive) relating to the profile, and provides a convenient place to see information about a {{linked case}} and a list of records linked to the {{linked case}}, as well as quickly create new records linked to it. If you are not using {{linked case}}s in this way, you can turn off this profile tab using this option. It is still possible to access {{linked case}}s through the main menu at {{work}}>view>{{linked case}}s.
   
 - **If so, you can specify a custom template for the "unlinked records" button here**

   If you have the {{linked case}} tab enabled on profiles (see option above), there is a button above the list of {{linked case}}s that shows all records not linked to a {{linked case}}. You can specify what text to appear in this button using the codes outlined in global settings menu.

- **Custom template for the open {{linked case}} buttons**

   As with the option above, it is possible to specify what text should appear in the open {{linked case}} buttons. You will need to have specified a custom template for unlinked records for this to take effect.
   
- **Custom template for the closed {{linked case}} buttons**

   As with the two options above, it is possible to specify what text should appear in the closed {{linked case}} buttons. Again, you will need to also specify a custom template for unlinked records for this to take effect.
