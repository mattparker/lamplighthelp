# 25.1.0    Create a new {{waiting list}}

> To create a new {{waiting list}}, from the main menu click on work, hover over add and click on {{waiting list}}s 

A new {{waiting list}} form will appear. You will need to work through the three tabs along the top in order to create your {{waiting list}}.

![add new {{waiting list}}]({{imgpath}}227a.png)

  1. Firstly, provide your list with a clear and full name and description.
  2. The second tab allows you to add {{waiting list}} members: to reach it either click over the tab label '{{waiting list}} members' or the next button. 
  3. The third tab, 'removal', lets you set options to determine how {{people}} should be removed from the list.

**Adding {{people}} to the {{waiting list}}.** On the second tab, go to the 'find {{people}}' search box, start to type the name of the {{person}} you wish to add to the {{waiting list}}. If they already have a profile within {{Lamplight}}, their name will appear in the drop down box. Click to add them to the table below. If however the {{person}} doesn't already have a profile, type in the full name in the search box to allow the system to check for duplicates. If their name doesn't appear, click on the 'add new people to database' button, and within the details box, add or amend any details and click to Save. If a linked profile is used (see section [18.4.0  Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.4.0)), both profile names will be added into the table.

Along from each name, member specific information can be added: you will need to enter the date they joined. Using your mouse, click inside the 'date joined' box and select the date on the popup calendar.

To change the month, use the arrows to the left or right or if you need to change the year, click over the central month and year, click okay when your selection has been made, then choose the specific day of that new month and/or year, click save to apply.

If you realise someone has been added in error, click on the red cross which will just remove them from this list. If the date has been entered incorrectly, click over the date and the calendar will re-appear: make the alterations and click to save.

**The 'removal' tab** allows you to select options so that your {{waiting list}} is automatically managed and updated, based on other {{work}} happening within the system. For example, if they are added to a {{work}} record or {{referral}} record {{Lamplight}} will automatically set the 'date left' on their entry in the {{waiting list}} to the date of the record.

![{{waiting list}} removal]({{imgpath}}227c.png)

The first option is based on {{work}} records. By ticking this selection as soon as the member on the list attends any {{work}} record as a {{user}} they will be removed from this {{waiting list}}. 

If you wish the members to be removed automatically when they attend a specific {{work}} record linked to a {{workarea}} and/or {{subworkarea}}, select the appropriate area. 

Removal from the list can also (or alternatively) be a done due to the member being involved in a {{referral}} as the 'service user being referred'. As soon as they are added to a {{referral}} record, the date the {{referral}} took place will transfer onto the {{waiting list}} as the date they left the {{waiting list}}.

You can choose if you wish, to receive an alert to appear when the members have been on the {{waiting list}} for a specified amount of time.  This takes the form of a {{task}} in the diary of the person chosen for notifications. Type in the amount in the number box and choose from the drop-down list whether it is days, weeks, months or years.  Then choose from the list below, who will be alerted.

You can also add a target time for people to be removed from a waiting list.  When viewing the waiting list, this will show those exceeding the time you choose, highlighted in red.

When all the information has been added, click the 'save' button on the bottom right hand corner. You have now created your new {{waiting list}}.

Once you have created a {{waiting list}}, there are a number of different ways to add or remove {{people}}.
