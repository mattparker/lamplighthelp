# 5.3  Relationships - Adding, Editing and Viewing History 

**Relationships link different {{people}} and {{org}}s in {{Lamplight}} together. A way of seeing connections they have to others in one table.**

A {{person}} or {{org}} may have any number of relationships to others in the database. You can manage these in the 'Relationships' tab in the profile.

For example, you may wish to record which people work with {{user}}s regularly, who their doctor is, their key worker, social worker, parole officer and other members of the family on the database or which other agencies, schools or partners are linked to them. You can record as many relationships as you need.
