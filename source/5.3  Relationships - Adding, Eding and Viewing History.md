# 5.3 Relationships - Adding, Editing and Viewing History 

**Relationships link different {{people}} and {{org}}s in {{Lamplight}} together. A way of seeing connections they have to others in one table.**

A {{person}} or {{org}} may have any number of relationships to others in the database. You can manage these in the 'Relationships' tab in the profile.

For example, you may wish to record which people work with {{user}}s regularly, who their doctor is, their key worker, social worker, parole officer and other members of the family on the database or which other agencies, schools or partners are linked to them. You can record as many relationships as you need.

### Add Relationships

5. Click on the 'Relation' drop down menu to open it, then choose the relationship the 2 profiles have
 
This needs to clearly identify the reason these two profiles are connected. Please note, new options can be added to this list by in-house system administrators. The list can be made unique to your organisation and your system requirements.

6. If you are using default contacts in your system, click the Default contact checkbox if you want to make them the default contact for the profile you’re creating a relationship to.
This may be appropriate if they are your main contact at a particular {{org}}, or for example a parent is the default contact for a child.

8. There may be an additional Relationships category drop down box. Click on this to see and select the correct option for this relationship
This is an option to further categorise the connection. This can be helpful if for example you're linking agencies connected to {{user}}s and you need to track if you've gained permission to share information with them or not, or you've a number of family members, but you need to categorise them in terms of suitability of contact.

### Edit Relationships
1. In the Relationships tab, click on the menu to the left of the relationship you need to change or right click on the row in the table

![5.3  Relationships - Adding, Eding and Viewing History1 - step 10](5.3__Relationships_-_Adding,_Eding_and_Viewing_History1_im_10.png)

2. Choose Edit relationship from the pop up menu
You can:
  - Move into the linked {{person}}'s profile by clicking 'view full details'.
  - Edit the relationship link.
  - Reverse the relationship. Relationships in {{Lamplight}} can be two way, for example you could have a Mentor (Mentee) relationship type. This would mean that one {{person}} is the mentor, and the other the mentee. (The actual relationship types that you have will be specific to your system). If the relationship is added the wrong way round, so in this instance the 'Mentor' would be showing as the 'Mentee' and vice versa, you can choose 'Reverse' to put this right.
  - Close relationship. This will move the relationship from the current table into the 'history'. 
  - Communication. You will only see this option if you have the {{Comm}}s Module. It opens a new {{comm}} record to communicate with linked {{person}} (not with the {{person}} whose profile you are in).
  - Copy address details from ..... This is useful if you are adding someone who they lives/works at the same address - a family member or employee, for example. {{Lamplight}} will copy the address directly from the profile in the table to the {{person}} or {{org}} linked to them, updating the 'Contact details' tab immediately. Note - this action cannot be undone.
