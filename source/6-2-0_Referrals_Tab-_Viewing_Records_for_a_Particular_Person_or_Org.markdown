> You can find details of all the {{referral}}s a particular {{person}} or {{org}} has been involved in by clicking the '{{Referral}}s tab in their profile



This '{{Referral}}s' tab in any profile displays a table of all the {{referral}}s where that {{person}} or {{org}} is included in the Attendance table or on the 'Involving' tab.

The default setting for viewing {{referral}} records is 5 to a page, but this can be changed by your system administrator through 'Global settings'(for more on this, see [16.12.4 Global Settings - Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4). Alternatively you can use the page numbers at the top of the table to move through the records.

To add a new {{referral}} from here, click on the 'Add' button on the right hand side of the screen. For more on creating new {{referral}} records see section [6.1.0  Adding a {{Referral}} Record](/help/index/p/6.1.0).

To view a {{referral}} record right click on the row in the table showing the {{referral}} record you would like to see. This brings up a menu with a range of options:

- View full details. You can open the record to view everything recorded there in one page. 
- Edit. If you need to change any details in this record, opening it to edit will allow you to do this. The record will be shown in the same format as if you were entering a new one. 
- Delete. Managers and System Administrators can delete {{referral}} records from the system. **If you do this they cannot be retrieved**.
- If you have, the {{Comm}}s Module, you will see the option to 'Communicate' This would open up a new {{comm}}s record which is already set up to send to all those in the attendance table of the {{referral}}.
- If you use {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see various {{linked case}} options on this menu. For more on {{linked case}}s, see [9.0.0 {{Linked Case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0).
