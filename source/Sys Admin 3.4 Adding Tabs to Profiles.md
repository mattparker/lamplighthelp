# 3.4 Adding Tabs to Profiles

The fourth tab in the ‘Operator Template’ is ‘Profile tabs’.  This is where you customise which profile tabs operators see, and in which order

This affects what tabs will be seen by operators when they look at a profile

If you leave this section blank, all available tabs will show. As soon as you selecct one tab to add to the Operator Template, only the ones you select will be shown when the operator looks at a profile. It&#039;s important to consider all the profile types and roles you are using in your system, and to add the tabs needed for all of them. Each tab will only appear in the profiles it applies to. For example, a {{staff}} tab will only appear in {{staff}} profiles.
To select profile tabs:
1. Click the tab you want to be added to the profile view from the {{group}} on the left hand side of the screen. It will then appear in the ‘Selected items appear here’ section in the middle

2. Change the order of tabs using the up and down arrows on the right hand side of each chosen item
If you add tabs in the order you want them to appear in the profile (left to right), it will save you changing the order later on.
