# 13.2.4 Using a {{Group}} Data View to Create a Summary Page

> You can add a summary tab to profiles. This will bring information from different tabs into one place. A {{group}} data view is used to select the information you want to see in this tab



A summary tab can be added to profiles which allows you to choose information from different tabs and show it in one place. It is fully customisable, and each database operator can set up a different summary tab, or share the same one. A {{group}} data view is used to set the prarmeters for the information that will be shown in the tab. You can change or remove the tab at any time.

To add a summary tab:

- Create a {{group}} data view including all the information you want on the summary tab (see section [13.1  Creating {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/13.1)). 
- Once this is saved, go to '{{Group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> view' on the main menu.
- Right-click on the {{group}} that you want to use, or click on the menu button to the left of it in the table.
- Choose 'use in summary tab in profiles' from the popup menu. 
- You will receive a confirmation message that the setting has changed.
- Now when you view a profile you'll see a new 'summary' tab displayed as the first tab.

To change the {{group}} data view you use, just repeat this process. 

To remove the summary tab completely, open a it tab in any profile, scroll to the bottom and click 'remove summary tab'.
