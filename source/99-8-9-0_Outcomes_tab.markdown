# 8.9.0    {{Outcome}}s tab

> The {{outcome}}s tab shows the change you've seen over time 

{{Outcome}}s information for the individual or organisation are displayed on this tab. They can also be added here.

{{Outcome}}s can be displayed as a radar diagram, in a 'data-entry' table, and in a simple table view. The radar chart shows and lets you add new data by clicking on the chart; the 'data-entry' table shows {{outcome}}s down the side and months along the top, and lets you add new measures in bulk.

This shows the {{outcome}}s information for this {{person}} only. The radar diagram shows an {{outcome}} on each axis. The position and colour of the line shows the score and date it was achieved. For example, the diagram above shows the results in July (brown, inner line); September (blue line) and October (green line). Exercise for this person has gone from a '1' in July (meaning they don't do much) to a '5' in October (meaning they are doing lots). In general (assuming larger numbers are 'better') you will hope that the shapes get gradually bigger as time goes on.

The 'data-entry' table lists all the {{outcome}}s down the right, and then months along the top. You can click a single cell, or existing score, to add or edit an {{outcome}}. The right-most column lets you add several {{outcome}}s at once; enter the scores, and then at the bottom of the table set the date and {{workarea}} and click to save.

The table view at the bottom of the page shows the date of the {{outcome}}, a summary of the result, and the {{linked case}}s it is attached to are displayed in the table.

The order in which the records are displayed can be changed by clicking on the column headings. The default setting for viewing outcomes is 5 to a page but more or less can be viewed at once by choosing an option from the select box. Alternatively you can use the numbers to move through the records.

To add new outcomes click on the Add button on the right hand side of the screen.
