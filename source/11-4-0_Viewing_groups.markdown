# 11.4.0    Viewing {{Group}}s

> To view all {{group}}s currently set up on your system, click {{Group}}s -> View all in the main menu. You will see a table listing all {{group}}s, their descriptions, and other details. 

![List of all groups](105a.png)

Note that the number shown in the '{{Group}} size' column will be for the last time you used the {{group}}, so for {{auto group}}s this figure may have changed. If you need to be sure how many members a {{group}} currently has, use the menu button on the left and select 'Quick view in popup' for an up-to-date list (see section [14.5.0  Viewing {{group}} members](/help/index/p/14.5.0)).
