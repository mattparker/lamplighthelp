# 3.5.0 Tables

> Tables are used in {{Lamplight}} to display information, and they can be searched and customised in a number of ways



There are many tables of information in {{Lamplight}}, like the one below.

This is the table that would be displayed if you were searching {{work}} records. 

Other places where tables are frequently used are:

- When viewing a {{report}} (see section [13.3.0 {{Work}} {{Report}}s](help/index/p/13.3.0)).
- On the 'relationships' tab of a profile [5.4.0 The Relationships Tab](help/index/p/5.4.0).
- When you add attendees to a {{work}} or other record [7.1.2 Adding Attendance Details to a {{Work}} Record](help/index/p/7.1.2).
- In the {{outcome}}s tab, you can view results in a table [8.1.6 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the {{Outcome}}s table](help/index/p/8.1.6).
- If you're viewing a group with a {{group}} data view (see section [13.0.0 {{Group}} Data Views](help/index/p/13.0.0) for more information).

The following pages will give you more information on how to view, filter and customise tables.
