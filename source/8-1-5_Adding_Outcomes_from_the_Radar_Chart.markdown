> It is possible to add {{outcome}} scores directly in the radar chart in an individual's profile



You can add {{outcome}} scores directly to the radar chart in the '{{Outcome}}s' tab of a profile. To do this:

- Find the profile that you want and open the '{{Outcome}}s' tab.
- Choose the {{outcome}}s you're reporting on from the 'Select outcomes to view' drop-down.
- In the 'Mode' box to the middle of the screen, choose 'add'.

This opens up a new box where you can enter in more details.

- Fill in the date that the {{outcome}} was measured, and the {{workarea}} that it relates to.
- Underneath that, use the boxes for each measure to add the score.
- At the bottom of the box, click 'save'.
- Alternatively you can click on the values on the radar chart itself to add scores. You still need to click 'save' at the bottom of the list of scores in the middle box when you have finished.

You can see a demonstration of this in our {{Outcome}}s video. See [51.5.1 {{Outcome}}s Records](/help/index/p/51.1.1).
