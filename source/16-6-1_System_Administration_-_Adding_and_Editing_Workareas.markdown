# 16.6.1 System Administration - Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s

> In system administration, you can see a list of current {{workareas}} in the '{{work}} and {{outcomes}}' section. The {{workarea}} itself is listed in bold with the {{subworkarea}}s listed below it. You can add to and edit these.

{{Workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s are managed in a similar to other lists within the system administration menu (see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/18.2.0) ).

### Things to consider when making changes to Work Areas

- When a work record is saved, the work and sub work areas selected within that record are saved within it.  
- If you then edit the {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}}, this will then change the {{work}} or {{subworkarea}} on all the records where that original one was recordd. For example, if you edit Counselling so that it is now Sports, every record that had a {{workarea}} of Counselling will now have one of Sports.  
- If you edit the name, you will no longer be able to filter or report on the previous work area. As in the above example, the list of filters for reports or {{grsoup}}s will show Sports, not Counselling. 
- If you delete the {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}} you will not be able to filter by the previous work areas.  The deleted areas/names, wonâ€™t show in the list of filters for a work report, or in Activity > View > Work, to allow you to select them.  However, if you run a report showing all {{work}} then choose to present it by {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}}, where there was data in one that has been deleted, this will still be shown in the table. (For more on reporting, see XXXXXXX).
- For this reason we suggest not removing work areas until then end of your reporting period.
- When you delete a {{workarea}} you are only deleting the category, not any of the historic work records related to it.


**Adding a New {{Workarea}}**

![Editing {{workarea}}s and {{outcome}}s](145a.png)

{{Workareas}} are added and edited in the same way as other drop-down lists, but they have another subset ({{subworkarea}}s) to think about.

- In system admin, go to Manage Fields and Drop-down Lists -> {{Work}} Records -> {{Workareas}}
- If you already have some {{workarea}}s you will see a page with a number of boxes. Scroll down the screen until you come to the bottom, where there is a box with  the text 'double-click to add'. If you have yet to set up any {{workarea}}s, this will be at the top of the page.
- Double click on this box, and it will become a text box which you can edit. Enter the name of your new {{workarea}} here, then press 'enter' on your keyboard to save. **Do not click outside this box until you have saved as this may cause the system to hang**.
- Once you have saved the {{workarea}}, you can create new {{subworkarea}}s for it in the 'double-click to add' box below. These work in the same way as the initial {{workarea}} textbox, so remember to press 'enter' to save each time. 
- If the {{workarea}} already exists and you simply want to create a new {{subworkarea}}, navigate to the {{workarea}} in the list, and at the bottom of the existing {{subworkarea}}s you will see a 'double-click to add' box. It is then the same process as described for adding a {{workarea}}.

- Always create and type in your {{workarea}} heading initially, so that it appears in bold, before adding the {{subworkarea}}s below it. 
- We would recommend that colours are added to {{workarea}}s after the headings have been entered. To do this,  double-click over 'Background colour' and move the cursor around the colour pad. When you have the colour you would like, press 'save'.

**Editing {{Workarea}}s**

Before editing or deleting {{workareas}} please see the notes above. As a general rule, you should only change the name of the {{workarea}} if the meaning is staying the same, for example due to a spelling error or a re-brand. 

- Hover over text you wish to change (whether Work area or sub work area) and double click to edit.  
- Once you have made your changes, press enter on your keyboard to save.


**To Delete a {{Workarea}} / {{Subworkarea}}**

Before you delete a {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}} see 'Things to Consider' above. 

You can delete a whole {{workarea}} with all its related {{subworkarea}}s in one go, or choose single {{subworkarea}}s individually.

- Left click and hold, then drag the box containing the {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}} the area to the bottom of the list.  
- Drop it in the box marked 'Drag here to delete'.
