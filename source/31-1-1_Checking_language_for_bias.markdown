# 31.1.1 Checking language for bias

> The language used in job adverts and documents can easily put people off unintentionally. Lamplight
> includes a tool to check.

Some language can be 'gender-coded' - that is, we repeat societal gender stereotypes (accidentally)
in our choice of language.  For example, 'feisty' is not a term you often hear used about men.  Some
of these words are not so obvious.

The bad news is that women are less likely to apply for jobs that use masculine coded language.

The good news is that removing masculine coded language does not put men off from applying.

Lamplight includes a simple tool that allows you to paste text of your advert or job description
(or anything really) and highlight gendered language.

It also includes some checks for other language that may be problematic and may put people off 
applying because it has racial or other connotations.

To check some text, go to 'people > {{recruiter}} > check language of advert'.  Paste your text
into the editor and press 'check language'.

It will check the text and highlight any terms that you may want to review and re-word.

This tool uses a similar approach to that here: https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/
although it extends the words to check beyond gender.  

The about page on that site https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/about gives an overview
 of the research that led to the tool, and a list of the words that are searched for, if you are interested.
