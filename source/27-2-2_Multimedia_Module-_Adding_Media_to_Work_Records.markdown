# 27.2.2 Media Module: Adding Media to {{Work}} Records

> You can add files and media to {{work}} and other {{activity}} records. These will be saved with the record, but also in the media tab on the profile of anyone listed as attending that record

### Adding Media to New {{Work}} Records

If you have the Media Module:

- You can either start a new record or edit an existing one. For more on adding {{work}} records, see [7.1.0 Adding a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.0). For more on editing them see [7.2.1 Edit a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.2.1).
- Go to the tab on that record called 'Media'.
- You will see a page where you can click to add a file from your computer.

- Click on the top 'Browse' button. A new pop-out box will appear.
- Navigate to the file that you would like to upload and click 'Open'. 
- You will see the 'Browse' box now has the name of the file you selected next to it.
- To add another file, click on the next 'Browse' button down.
- When you have added all you need, finish editing the work record and click 'save' at the bottom of any page.

### Adding Media when Viewing Records

You can also add media to records when viewing them.

- Find the record that you would like to add media to either in the {{person}} or {{org}}'s profile, or in {{activity}}->view->{{work}}.
- Scroll across the row to find the column called 'Files', and click on it. (If you can't see it initially, right-click on the header row of the table to se available columns, and tick next to 'files'. This will add it to the your table.)
- This will bring up a box giving details of the files already attached to the record, and the option to attach more. 
- Click on the 'Browse' button to find the file that you want, then 'save'.
- Alternatively you can click on the menu button to the left of the record (or right click in the table row) to bring up the context menu.
- Choose 'View full details'.
- Scroll to the bottom of the record, where there is a section headed 'Media'. Here you can choose to add files from the internet, select files from your computer, or drag and drop them into the grey box.
