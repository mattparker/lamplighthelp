# 18.2.3    System Administration - relationships

> Relationship types can be added in the same way as all lists in {{Lamplight}}: see section [18.2.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0) for more. 

Relationship types can be added via the list method. To add, edit or delete relationships go to admin -> system administration -> relation types between people 

Double click to add a new relation type, press enter on your keyboard to save. You have the option to allow the relationship to be used in linked records: {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s, {{referral}} and {{comm}}s. The default option is set at no, double click over the word no if you wish to change it, press enter to save your choice.

If you do this, then {{people}} linked together by this relationship will appear in the 'search as you type' box when adding them to a {{work}} etc. record. The record will then appear on the profile of both {{people}} in the relationship.
