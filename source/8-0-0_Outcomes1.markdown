# 8.0.0    {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s in Lamplight measure the change over time in the {{people}} you work with. You measure how each {{person}} is doing at different times, and as time goes by you can see the changes that have occurred. 


{{Outcome}}s are the impact your work has on individuals or organisations, measured by showing changes over time that you or they observe. The core Lamplight system enables you to take a series of 'snapshots' at different times, and see how those snapshots change as time goes by. 

For example, your organisation may be working to improve the self-confidence of the {{people}} you work with. In January you could measure how confident John felt on a scale of 1-10, and enter it into Lamplight. A couple of months later you measure John again. Then three months after that you ask John again how confident he feels. In five months you can show how much improvement there has been in John's confidence levels. 

Lamplight lets you follow what happens to individuals (in their profiles), but also to see the overall impact for everyone you are working with. {{Outcome}} {{report}}ing in {{Lamplight}} looks primarily at **change**, so you will need to record at least a starting position and a final position for the change to show in the report. (For more on Outcomes Reporting, see XXXXXXXXX).

Collecting this type of data can be very powerful. It is possible to then {{report}} on the amount of change {{user}}s experience overall, as well as looking at how quickly change occurs, and how this varies between different groups of {{people}}. It is also possible to look at the relationship between the amount of {{work}} you have done, and the impact it has had.

{{Lamplight}} lets you collect this kind of data for your {{user}}s, whether they are people, families or organisations. But if you want to you could also use outcomes with {{staff}} to track their development, for example, or with partner agencies to see if you have any impact on their practices.

In some cases it will not be possible or appropriate to collect this data in this way. For example, you may run a one-off training session and ask participants to complete an evaluation form at the end of the session. In this case there is no baseline position, and you will need to be able to {{report}} '78% of participants felt that the training was valuable'. You may then compare this with previous years: **but the participants are (most likely) different people.** This is a different type of data, which in {{Lamplight}} uses the {{Eval}} module: see section [15.0.0  {{Eval}}s module overview](/help/index/p/15.0.0) for more details.
