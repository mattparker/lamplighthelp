# 51.2.0 Profiles

> These videos cover how to create and edit a profile in {{Lamplight}}

Profiles in Lamplight are where you keep individual information on the people, organisations and families that you work with. This includes contact details, demographic information (such as age and gender), and relationships between the people and organisations in your system. If you want to keep data about a new person or organisation you will first need to create a profile for them. The process for adding any type of profile is the same.
