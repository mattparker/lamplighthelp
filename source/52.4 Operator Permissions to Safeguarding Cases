# 52.4 Operator Permissions to {{Safeguarding Cases}}

> Access to full details about a {{safeguarding case}} is only available to {{Safeguarding}} Managers or {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s. Others see limited data.

{{Safeguarding}} Managers can see full information and make any changes to all {{safeguarding case}}s. We would generally recommend that a
manager assign themselves as a {{safeguarding lead contact}} if they are going to take responsibility for and make changes to
a {{safeguarding case}}.

{{Safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned to particular {{safeguarding case}}s. A {{safeguarding lead contact}} may be 
any database operator. A {{Safeguarding lead contact}} of a {{safeguarding case}} can see full information and make almost
any changes to that {{safeguarding case}}. For more information on how to assign {{safeguarding lead contact}}s see
[52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions](/help/index/p/52.2.3).

Other staff can see a very limited summary of all {{safeguarding case}}s and are not able to make any changes or add any 
information to {{safeguarding case}}s. They will be able to see:

1. The dates 

2. The status

3. Any shared details added to the {{safeguarding case}} by a {{Safeguarding lead contact}} (for more information on this see
[52.2.3 Proceeding with a {{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions](/help/index/p/52.2.3).
