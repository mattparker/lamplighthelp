# 3.9.0 Hidden Information

> Lamplight uses filters on some tables, so data remains hidden on screen until you need them.



Sometimes information is hidden until you need it so that the screen doesn't become cluttered. This could be when you're
viewing a table of {{activity}} records, or at the top of a text box. When this happens you will see a bar above the table with the text 'Filter - Click to change filters to see more or fewer records

![A hidden search bar](3.9.0a.png)

When selected, this reveals a menu of the filters that can be applied to either expand or reduce the number of records shown in the table.
Once you've made your selection, click 'fetch data' in the bottom right hand corner of the page.

For record tables, you can alter the default dates that are being applied as a personal setting, so you always see the dated records you're interested in.
For more information on this see [16.4.3 Personal_Settings - Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3)
