# 16.5.6 Password Policy

> Password policies set rules for database operator passwords

A system or project administrator can determine the rules for all passwords on their {{Lamplight}} system. For example, your organisation’s IT policy may require passwords to be at least 10 characters long with a mixture of characters. You can set this up in {{Lamplight}} to ensure that everyone has a long enough password. Password policies apply to all database operators.

**To set up a password policy**

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, and then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage Database Operators’ section, click ‘Set up or edit your password policy’.
- You will see the following options. Tick the ones that you wish to apply, and click ‘save’ when done:
- Whichever options you choose, when operators next change their passwords they will have to comply with this policy.
