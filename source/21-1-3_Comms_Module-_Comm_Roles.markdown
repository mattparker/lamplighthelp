# 21.1.3 {{Comm}}s Module: {{Comm}} Roles

<<<<<<< HEAD:source/21-1-3_Comms_Module-_Comm_Roles.markdown
> {{Comm}} roles mean that you can assign different roles to {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in {{comm}}s. These are like roles in {{activity}} record attendance tables, and are used to generate advanced mail merges

### Why use {{comm}} roles

Ordinarily, if you create a mail-merge letter, a copy is created for each recipient listed.  Their details will be substituted into the document wherever you have data placeholders.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to combine data from several profiles into a single document.  For example, you may need to write to a parent with merged data from their profile and their child.  Or you may be writing a letter on behalf of a client and their carer.  In these circumstances you don't want three different documents, you want one, with the relevant names and data in the right place.  This is when you would use {{comm}} roles.  

{{Comm}} roles are the way that {{Lamplight}} uses to determine which profiles information goes where.  In the recipients table you select the relevant role for each profile.  In your {{comm}} content, you specify which role each mail merge field should use.  So instead of mail-merge fields like [first name], you would have [parent first name] and [child first name].
