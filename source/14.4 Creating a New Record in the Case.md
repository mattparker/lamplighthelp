# 14.4 Creating a New Record in a {{Linked case}}

It is possible to create a {{work}} or other {{activity}} record directly in a {{linked case}}, so that you do not have to link it later
If you use {{linked case}}s as part of your process, and know what {{linked case}} a record needs to go in when you are adding it to the system, you can add a new record from within that {{linked case}}.
To do this:

1. Go to the &#039;{{Linked case}} view&#039; tab in the {{person}} or {{org}}&#039;s profile.

2. Find the {{linked case}} that you want to add the record to from the boxes on the left-hand side of the screen.
Click on this box to open the {{linked case}}.

3. At the top of the screen, click on &#039;Add {{activity}} to {{linked case}}â€™, click on the record type that you are adding ({{work}}, {{referral}}, {{outcome}} etc).
