# 14.4.1 {{Outcome}} {{Report}}s - Data Produced When Looking at Change

> The 'Difference between earliest and latest scores' finds records for people who have had the {{outcome}} measure scored at least two times within the dates specified. It works out the difference between the first and last scores in the date range, then calculates the averages for everyone



If you select 'Difference between earliest and latest scores' in the 'How to summarise the data' section of '{{Report}} presentation', you will see a table similar to this:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}}ing - difference between scores](13.4.1a.png)

### Table Columns

- The columns in this table show:

  - {{Outcome}} - the name of the particular {{outcome}} measure.
  - Average change - the mean change across all {{people}} included in the {{report}}.
  - Average initial score - the mean initial score across all {{people}} in the {{report}}.
  - Average final score - the mean last score recorded within the date range for all {{people}} in the {{report}}.
  - Number of people w. some data - the number of {{people}} that had their scores included in the {{report}}. They will need to have at least two scores for the {{outcome}} measure in the date range.
  - Percentage with positive change - percentage of {{people}} included in the {{report}} whose later score has moved in a positive direction compared to the first (usually gone up).
  - Percentage negative change - percentage of {{people}} where the later {{outcome}} was less positive than the earlier (usually gone down). 
  
- There are more columns that you can add to your table, for example the number of {{people}} with positive and negative change, rather than the percentages. To see the extra columns that are available, right click the coloured header row of the table.

### Visualisation

- To view any of the measures using one of these visualisations, click on the menu button to the left of it in the table, or right click the table row. This will bring up a menu:

  - **Radar Chart**
  
  ![The Radar Chart](13.4.0e.png)
  
  This shows all of the measures for the {{outcome}} category, plotted by their average initial and final scores.
  
  - **Infographic**

  This is a visual depiction of the measure selected, using text and arrorws to demonstrate the changes.
 
   - **Scatterplot**
   
   ![The Scatterplot](13.4.0g.png)
   
   Each point on this chart relates to the scores for one person. The yellow dots represent {{people}} whose scores have changed, blue dots those whose scores remained the same. It is a visual representation of the range of results achieved by individuals.
