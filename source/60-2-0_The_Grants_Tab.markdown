# 60.2.0 The {{Grant}}s Tab: Viewing Individual {{Grant}} Records

> The '{{Grant}}s' tab in a profile shows the detail of the {{grant}} records held for that {{person}} or {{org}}

If you need to see a {{person}} or {{org}}'s {{grant}} activity, the '{{Grant}}s' tab in their profile is the best place to look. When you open it you will see a table of all the records where they have been included in the attendance table.

The default setting for viewing {{referral}} records is 5 to a page, but this can be changed by your system administrator through 'Global settings'(for more on this, see [16.12.4 Global Settings - Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4). Alternatively you can use the page numbers at the top of the table to move through the records.

### The Search Bar

If you can't see the record that you want in the table, it may be that you need to change the dates of the displayed records. To do that:

- Click on the 'Search' bar above the table.

- Change the filter dates so that they include the dates you need, then click 'fetch data' under the filters.

There are other filter options here too - you can choose to restrict the records you see to specific {{workarea}}s, for example. If you choose any of these filters, it will reduce the number of records that you see in your table.

There is also an 'additional data columns to display' section, which you can use to include additional information in your results table.

It works in the same was as the search bar in {{work}} records - you can find out more about it in [7.3 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0).

### Viewing and Editing Individual Records

You can also open individual records from the table.

To view a {{grant}} record, right click on the row in the table showing the {{referral}} record you would like to see. This brings up a menu with a range of options:

- View full details. You can open the record to view everything recorded there in one page. 
- Edit. If you need to change any details in this record, opening it to edit will allow you to do this. The record will be shown in the same format as if you were entering a new one. 
- Duplicate record. This copies the record, so that if you are adding one that is similar you can then go to edit the copied version. You need to remember to change the details, and delete any information that is not needed in the new version.
- Delete. Managers and System Administrators can delete {{grant}} records from the system. **If you do this they cannot be retrieved**.
- If you use {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see various {{linked case}} options on this menu. For more on {{linked case}}s, see [9.0.0 {{Linked Case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0). 


### Downloading and Printing the Table
Underneath the table there are options to download and print it. 

#### Downloading to a Spreadsheet

Just above the table, make sure that the 'Show' drop-down is set to 'all'. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the table and click the 'Download' button.  
- Depending on your browser, your table may immediately open in a spreadsheet, or you may need to click on a 'Download' box at the bottom of the screen to open it.

#### Opening Print View

- Clicking the 'Print' button at the bottom of the table will open it in a new tab in a print-friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print-friendly tables split by whatever item you choose, for example {{workarea}}. Each one will open in a separate tab.

See [3.5 Tables](/help/index/p/3.5.0) for more help on using tables.
