# 7.1.1 Work Records: When and Where

> The 'When and where' tab stores information about the date, time, {{workarea}} and location of the {{work}} session



### Date and Time
The date and time on a {{work}} record is required. It will be used to add the record to the homepage diary, and also in calculations of how long sessions have taken when reporting. 

When you select the start time the end time will automatically change. The default length of work records is one hour, but this may have been changed in your system. When you set the date, {{Lamplight}} will change the 'to' date so that it matches the 'from' one. This will usually be the case, unless you are working into the small hours of the morning, or counting an overnight stay as work. If it is a session which resumes over a number of days - a week of training for example - this can be set up as a recurring record. For more on this see [7.1.5 Recurring {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.1.5).


### {{Workarea}}s
You must select a {{workarea}} (it is only possible to choose one), and any number of {{subworkarea}}s. 
To add a {{workarea}}, click on the appropriate radio button / {{workarea}}. The {{subworkarea}}s will appear in a pop-out box to the side of this. Choose any {{subworkarea}} checkboxes which apply.

### Locations
If locations are activated in your system, you will find them below {{workarea}}s. You can select as many as you need. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect. These let you view your {{activity}} records by location in the diary, as well as being used as a filter in {{report}}s.

### Custom Fields
There may be other custom fields on this page which are specific to your system. If you are unsure how to complete these, please ask your System Administrator.

If you'd like to see how this works in practice, you can view our video ['Creating a Work Record'](/help/index/p/51.4.1).
