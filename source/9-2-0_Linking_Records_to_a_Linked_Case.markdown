# 9.2.0 <i class="fas fa-link"></i>  Linking Records to a {{Linked Case}}

> Once you have a {{linked case}} you will want to add records to it. You can do this from the context menu of the {{activity}} record, or in the table of records



### To Link a Record to the {{Linked Case}} from the {{Activity}} Record Context Menu

- Find the record that you want to link. This could be in the '{{Linked Case}} tab, or elsewhere in the system (in the {{Activity}} -> View -> {{Work}} table, for example). 
- Right click on the row of the table that it is in or left click on the context menu to the left of the record. 
- This will bring up a context menu.

- Click 'link to {{linked case}}'. (If you do not see this option it is because it is not enabled in your system. Your System Administrator will be able to change this if required - see [16.12.4 Global Settings: Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4).) 
- This will open a pop-up box where you can start typing the name of the {{linked case}} to find the one that you need. Once it appears in the list, click on it to add the record.

### To Link a Record in the Table

In the table of records in a person's profile:
- Find another record which is already linked to the same {{linked case}}. 
- Drag and drop the record that you are adding on top of the initial linked record.

- This will add the second record to the same {{linked case}}. 

**Please note:** This option is not possible in systems where there is a search bar above the table. 


Once a record is linked to a {{linked case}} it appears in the '{{linked case}} view' tab, within the {{linked case}} that it is connected to (you can see all the {{linked case}}s in boxes down the left side of the page). It also continues to appear as normal in its appropriate tab, for example the {{work}} records tab. 


### What to Look for If 'Link to {{Linked Case}}' Is Not an Option on the Menu

- If a record is already linked to a {{linked case}}, you cannot link it to another. The 'link to {{linked case}}' option will be disabled (grey text). You will need to remove the link to the existing {{linked case}} first (see section [9.5.0 Removing a Link to a {{Linked Case}}](/help/index//p/9.5.0)).

- You also cannot link a record to a {{linked case}} which has been closed. In this instance you will need to re-open the {{linked case}} before you can attach the record. For information on this, (see section [9.7.0 Re-opening a Closed {{Linked Case}}](/help/index//p/9.7.0)).
