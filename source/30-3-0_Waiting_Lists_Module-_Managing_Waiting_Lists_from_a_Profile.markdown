# 30.3.0 {{Waiting List}}s Module: Managing {{Waiting List}}s from a Profile

> It is possible to add {{people}} and {{org}}s to {{waiting list}}s directly from their profile



Within a profile there is a {{Waiting list}} tab (if you have the module and can't see this tab it may be that you have not chosen to view it. See [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2) for more about viewing and hiding tabs in a profile). 

When you click on this tab you will see a table of all of the {{waiting list}}s this {{person}} or {{org}} currently belongs to, if any.

To add them to an existing {{waiting list}}:

- Click on the 'add' button on the right hand side. 
- In the pop-up box, tick the {{waiting list}}(s) as appropriate.
- Click 'save'.

The table in the profile tab will automatically update, showing that the {{person}} or {{org}} has been added to the {{waiting list}}, the date that they joined and the amount of time that they have been on it. 

The context menu for each {{waiting list}} can be accessed via the menu button in the left hand column, or by right-clicking on the relevant row of the table - see [30.2 - managing {{waiting list}}s](/help/index/p/30.2) for more information about these actions.
