# 22.1.0 Setting Up {{Eval}}s

> A System Administrator can set up new {{eval}} templates for you to use in {{Lamplight}}

### To Set Up a New {{Eval}}

**Adding an {{Eval}}**

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- Scroll to the bottom 'Module Administration' section, find the '{{Eval}}s Module' box and click on ‘Manage {{eval}} templates’.
- The structure of this page will be familiar to those who have edited custom fields in profiles or records, and it works in the same way as those pages. The left-hand column shows existing {{eval}}s.
- Click the grey ‘click to add’ button. This will reveal options in the middle column.
- Double-click the non-bold text, ‘{{Eval}} title: click to add’ to open a dialogue box.

- In the 'Text' box, give the {{eval}} a name.
- If the system has multiple projects, specify to which the {{eval}} applies.
- Click save when done, and the name will appear in the middle column.

**Please note:** Once an {{eval}} has been created in this way you need to add at least one question, even if it’s just a placeholder, before leaving the page. If you do not do this the {{eval}} will appear blank, and it will no longer be editable. If this happens, please contact Lamplight for support.

**Adding a Field to an {{Eval}}**

- Click the ‘click to add’ button to reveal options in the right-hand column.

- Double-click the non-bold text ‘Question: click to add’.
- In the dialogue box that appears, write the question in the ‘Text’ field.

- Using the ‘Type’ field, select the type of field you wish to use. The options are as follows:
   - Select box: a drop-down list allowing a single selection.
   - Multi-select box: a drop-down box allowing the selection of multiple items (by holding Ctrl).
   - Text box: a single-line text-entry field.
   - Text area: a larger, rectangular text-entry field that can be resized.
   - Date selector: allows date, month and year to be specified.
   - Checkbox: a single option with a box that can be ticked.
   - Radio button: a single option with a circular button that can be ticked.
   - Date/time selector: allows date, month, year and time to be specified.
   - Rich text editor: the largest text-entry field, with formatting options.
   - Number box: a field that only accepts numbers with no spaces (if you need to allow spaces, use a text box).
   - Date of birth selector: like the date selector, but displays age when viewing.
   - Caption: a large, bold heading (does not record information from respondents).
   - Fixed text box: a line of regular text used as a guide or sub-heading (does not record information from respondents).
   - Year selector: allows a year to be specified.
   - Radio buttons select-one: a series of options with circular buttons, only one of which can be selected, also offering a ‘none’ option.
   - Checkboxes select-many: a series of options with checkboxes, one or more of which can be selected.
   - Charity number lookup: a text field where you can enter an English charity number, which then provides a link to the charity page on the Open Charities site.
   - Twitter name: a text field in which to enter a Twitter name, which provides a link to the Twitter profile.
   - Web address: a text field in which to enter a web address, which provides a link to the website.
       
- To make a field mandatory, tick the ‘Is this a required field’ box. This means the {{eval}} won’t save until an answer has been given.
- Click the ‘save’ button.

**Adding Options to Select Fields**

If the field has a list of options, these must now be added.
- Once the question has been saved it will be shown in the column on the right. 
- Enter the options, each one separated by a semi-colon, into the box at the bottom of the right-hand column. Don’t enter any spaces on either side of the semi-colon.

- Click the ‘Add’ button below. The items will appear in a list above. 
- This list can be reordered by clicking and dragging. 
- List items can be deleted individually by clicking on the 'Del' button to the right of them.

**Adding More Fields**

- You can continue adding fields using the process above (clicking the ‘click to add’ button in the middle column) until the {{eval}} fields are all in place.

**Testing Your {{Eval}}**  

Once an {{eval}} has been created, try completing it to ensure everything is displayed as intended. 
- First refresh the page in your browser (by pressing F5 in Windows or Ctrl+R in OS X), and it will then be accessible through the main menu. 
- For more on completing {{eval}} information, please see [22.2.0 Adding and Editing {{Eval}} Responses](/help/index/p/22.2.0).

**Creating Another {{Eval}}**

There is no limit to the number of {{eval}}s you can have in {{Lamplight}}. To add more follow the process above (clicking the ‘click to add’ button in the left-hand column).
