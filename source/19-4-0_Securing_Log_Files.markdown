# 19.4 Securing Log Files

> Log files contain sensitive data and if you download it, should be appropriately secured.

Log data will include personally identifiable information, and needs to be protected in the same way that the rest of
your data does. While stored in Lamplight your log files are stored securely, with the rest of your data, and is
encrypted and has access restricted to system administrators.

However if you download log data from the report or the archives you will now have this sensitive data on your computer.
You will need to follow your own Information Security guidance for this, but weâ€™d recommend that you save it to
encrypted storage and ensure that it can only be viewed by authorised people.
