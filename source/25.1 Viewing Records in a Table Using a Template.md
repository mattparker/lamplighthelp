# 25.1 Viewing Records in a Table Using a Template

If you often view your {{work}} records and would like to save your filter settings, system administrators can set up activity view templates

If you often view tables of records through the main menu ({{Activity}} -> view) it is possible to save the filters and extra columns that you frequently use as a template. For example, these could be columns for {{volunteer}}s attending and specific filters like {{workarea}} and dates, so that the table is ready each time you need it. 

Templates need to be set up by System Administrators. For more on how to do this, please see [16.10.0 Creating {{Activity}} List Templates](/help/index/p/16.10.0).

1. Click on Activities on the top menu bar
All the different types of records will show in their own box

2. To view all records with no filters or extra columns use the &#039;view xxx records&#039; button
