# 16.3.0    Add, edit and delete {{staff}} training information

> Go to the {{staff}} members profile and click on the tab you wish to enter information into. On the right hand side of the screen click 'add'. 

For each of the {{staff}} module tabs a similar procedure can be followed to add, edit and delete information. Go to the {{staff}} members profile and click on the tab you wish to enter information into. On the right hand side of the screen an Add button can be found, by clicking on this a new form opens for you to enter details into.

The process required here follows a similar process that is used when adding {{work}} records (see section [9.1.0  Adding a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.0)). The record is split into tabs; when and where, attendance and details. These must be completed before choosing to save. 

As you continue to enter records into a tab, the table of information builds. Once in table format you can edit and/or delete information. Right click over the row of information you wish to alter and the context menu will appear. Choose the action you wish to take.
