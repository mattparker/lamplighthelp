# 3.4 My Users

**'My {{user}}s' are the {{user}}s you {{work}} with most often**

There will often be {{user}}s, {{contact}}s or {{funder}}s that you {{work}} with regularly. Rather than searching for them or browsing through long lists, you can create a 'My {{user}}' relationship with them, and they will then be listed in the 'My {{user}}s' tab on your home page. 

(If the 'My {{user}}s' tab doesn't appear on your home page, you may a system administrator to add it to your operator template - see [103 Creating and Editing Operator Templates](/help/index/p/103).)

The relationship between you and your {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} will need to be set up in the 'Relationships' tab on the profile.  See section [5.3  Relationships - Adding, Eding and Viewing History](/help/index/p/5.3) for more information on how to do this. 

Once the tab is visible and a relationship has been created, you can use the tab to see all the {{people}} or {{org}}s who have a My {{user}} relationship to you, almost like your own personal address book.

1. Click on My {{user}} on your home page and you will see all the {{user}}s linked to you with this &#039;my user&#039; relationship

2. To see details of a particular profile, click on the menu button in the left column of the table next to their name

3. You will see the options for that profile:
 - View profile - opens the user profile.
 - Edit relationship - allows you to edit the relationship. 
 - Reverse relationship- allows you to reverse the relationship (so if you have a manager/staff relationship, for example - this allows you to switch which person in the manager, and which the staff member).
 - Close relationship - removes the relationship from the list, but not from the system.
 - Communication - opens a new {{comm}} page where you can send an email, text or write a letter (you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module).
 - Copy address from.... - It is unlikely that you will need to use this when looking in the My {{user}}s tab, as choosing this option will copy the address details of this {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} into the Contact Details tab on your own profile, replacing your current details. It is not possible to undo this action.
