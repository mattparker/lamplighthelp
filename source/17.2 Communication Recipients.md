# 17.2 {{Comm}} Recipients

**The &#039;Recipients&#039; tab is where you add the profiles and {{org}}s you are sending the {{comm}} to. You can enter individual names, or use a {{group}} to add recipients in bulk Adding Recipients**

1. Click on Recipients tab

2. Search for the profile(s) you wish to create the {{comm}} for, click the name to add them to the record (attendance table)
-These are added in the same way that you add attendees to {{work}} records: see section [7.1 Adding Work Record Details](/help/index/p/7.1) for more help.
- If adding a {{group}}, all current members will be added to the table.
- If anyone has opted out of the type of {{comm}} that you are setting up, their contact details will not appear in the table.

3. The &#039;Mail merge options&#039; section refers to linked profiles.

The 'Mail merge options' section refers to linked profiles. These are not switched on in all systems, but if they are in yours you will see names linked to other names when you type in the search box. For example, you might see 'Lamplight Database Systems Ltd, Matthew Parker'. This means that the 'Lamplight Database Systems Ltd' is linked to 'Matthew Parker'.

- If you click on that option in the {{group}}, then both Lamplight and Matthew Parker will be added to the table.
- If you use linked profiles in Lamplight, the &#039;Mail-merge options&#039; let you decide whose address details you are going to use to send the {{comm}} to. So, in the example above, if you want to send a letter to Lamplight Database Systems, but have it delivered to Matt Parker&#039;s address, choose to use the address details of the &#039;second profile {{group}}ed&#039;. (Lamplight Database Systems is the first profile in the attendance table).
- If this is not possible for some reason (i.e. the contact details for the linked profile are not in the system), then Lamplight will revert to using the contact details from the first profile. It will always check permissions before sending.
- Some relationships may need to be &#039;allowed&#039; to be used in your {{comm}}s. Your System Administrator can alter these settings via the Admin menu under &#039;Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down {{Group}}s -&gt; {{People}} and {{Org}}s -&gt; Relation types between profiles&#039;. See section [106 Profiles - adding and editing relationship types](/help/index/p/106) for more information.
- If you are creating a letter or mailing labels, the system will add a copy of the message content for each recipient, so that any mail-merge fields can be included. This means that if your letter is one page long, and you&#039;re sending it to 10 profiles, the document produced will be 10 pages long.
