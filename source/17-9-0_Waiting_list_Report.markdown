# 17.9.0    {{Waiting list}} {{Report}}

> {{Waiting list}} {{report}}s show you the number of {{people}} on your {{waiting list}}s over time, and the length of time they have been on them. 

The {{waiting list}} {{report}} provides a number of ways to analyse the numbers and size of your {{waiting list}}s. As with other {{Lamplight}} {{report}}s, there are several tabs that let you define how your data should be filtered and presented.

On the first tab, select the date ranges as normal, and a {{group}} if needed. You can also restrict the {{report}} to particular {{waiting list}}s if needed, too.

If available, the {{project}}s tab will aggregate data across several {{project}}s (see [17.1.2  {{Report}}s across several {{project}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.2)).

The final tab, report presentation provides options on the way data is shown, the way dates are handled, and allows you to {{report}} based on the information in particular fields on profiles.

The 'How to summarise the data' has three options: the default is **show overall statistics for the period.** This gives the following data for each {{waiting list}}:

  1. Number of {{people}} at the start of the period: on the first day in the range specified, how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}}?
  2. Number joining the {{waiting list}} in the period: how many have been added between the two dates?
  3. Number leaving the {{waiting list}} in the period
  4. Total number of different {{people}} - one {{person}} may be on the same {{waiting list}} more than once in the date range, but they will only be counted once each in this column. This may mean that this figure is different to the previous columns
  5. The mean time spent on {{waiting list}} gives a 'calendar time' waiting time, averaged over everyone on the {{waiting list}}. The 'date to' specified in the Report filters section of the {{report}} will be used as the 'date left' for any {{people}} still on the {{waiting list}} on the 'date to'. This may mean that the figure changes, depending on the 'date to' that you set.
  6. The mean time spent on {{waiting list}} (weekdays) is a similar calculation but excludes weekends (but not bank holidays etc.)

This report gives you a sense of turnover, in the first four columns, and total waiting times, in the final two.

To see how this changes over time, you can change the 'how to summarise the data' to **'weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'** or **'monthly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'**. These two do the same thing, but over different time spans. When you run the {{report}} using either of these, you'll see a table listing the different {{waiting list}}s down the side, and the dates (weeks or months) along the top. Each figure in the table is the number of {{people}} on the waiting list each week (or month). Below that is a graph showing the same data. {{Lamplight}} calculates these figures by checking how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}} each day, and then averaging this over the number of days in the week (i.e. 7) or month (which varies). Between two dates, then, this {{report}} shows you how demand for your services has varied week-by-week or month-by-month.
