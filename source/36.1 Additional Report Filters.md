# 36.1 Additional Report Filters

Every system has filters based on the custom fields. These can be found in the second 'Additional filters' tab

1. You may see a second drop-down is called Additional filters. You will only see this if you have custom fields in your record to filter by.

Each system may have custom fields that have been added so that Lamplight collects the specific information that an organisation needs. Every system is set up slightly differently, so the filters you see are likely to be unique to your  organisation. Any custom fields in {{work}} records which are reportable will show under this dropdown.
