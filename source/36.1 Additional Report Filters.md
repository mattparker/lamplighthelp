# 1. The second drop down is called Additional filters

Each system will have custom fields that have been added so that Lamplight collects the specific information that an {{org}} needs. Every system is set up slightly differently, so the filters you see are likely to be unique to your {{org}}. Any custom fields in {{work}} records which are {{report}}able will show under this dropdown.
