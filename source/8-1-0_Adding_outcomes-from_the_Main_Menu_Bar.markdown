# 8.1.0    Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Main Menu Bar

> To add an {{outcome}} record, go to {{Work}}->Add->{{Outcome}}s on the main menu. 

**Need to show can add Outcomes records from different places - radar chart, outcomes tab, table in the outcomes tab***

To add an {{outcome}} record, go to {{Work}}->Add New->{{Outcome}}s on the main menu. You will see the main screen for entering {{outcome}} records:

![Adding an {{outcome}} record](74a.png)

The first two tabs, 'When and where' and 'attendance' are standard (see [11.1.1  Adding {{outcome}}s - when and where](/help/index/p/11.1.1) and [11.1.2  Adding {{outcome}}s - attendance](/help/index/p/11.1.2)): the remaining tabs are the names of the {{outcome}} categories you (or your system administrator) have set up. It is also possible to customise the system to add extra fields and tabs, so your system may differ to the example here. See section [18.4.0  Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields](/help/index/p/18.4.0) for more information about customising {{outcome}} records.

In some systems, the attendance tab in Outcomes may be called 'Respondent'.  This operates in a simpler fashion.  Simply complete the two fields.  Enter the {{user}} name in 'Outcome about {{user}}' field, and enter the name of the staff member in 'Outcome recorded by/with {{staff}} field.  This alternative approach can be changed in Global settings. (See section [18.1.3 Global Settings])(/help/index/p/18.1.3)

When you have added all information in all the relevant tabs, click the 'save' button in the bottom right.
