# 8.1.0 Adding an {{Outcome}}s Record

> There are a number of different places that you can add {{outcomes}} records for your {{user}}s. If you want to open up the whole {{outcome}}s record, you can do this from the main menu, profile or the context menu of a {{work}} record

You can open up new {{outcome}} record to edit all the details, add notes and record scores for a number of different measures in one go. Although like all {{activity}} records, {{outcome}}s are stored centrally, you can get to them in a number of different places.

- From the main menu choose '{{Activity -> add new -> {{outcome}}.

- In the '{{Outcome}}s' tab of a profile, click on the 'Add' button on the right of the page.

- In a {{work}} record context menu, choose 'Add {{outcome}}s'(for more on {{work}} record context menus see [7.2.0 Viewing {{Work}} Records for an Individual](/help/index/p/7.2.0) and [7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0)).

If you open the record from here it will automatically add the same time and date, {{workarea}}, {{user}}s and {{staff}} as are entered in the {{work}} record. You will need to remember to change these as necessary. We would advise that you only use this if there is a single {{user}} attending the {{work}} record. It is only possible to record one set of results per {{outcome}} record, and it is unusual that two {{user}}s would have exactly the same results. 

It is also possible to add {{outcome}} scores to an individual through the {{Outcome}}s tab in their profile:
- [8.1.5 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Radar Chart](/help/index/p/8.1.5)
- [8.1.6 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Advanced Table](/help/index/p/8.1.6)

For a demonstration of adding {{outcome}}s, why not see our video?
