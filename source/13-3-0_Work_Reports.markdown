#    13.3.0 Work {{Reports}}

> If you need to report on the {{work}} that you have been doing, then choose a {{work}} report. 

{{Work}} {{report}}s provide a number of options of how to present and analyse your data, in the '{{Report}} Presentation' tab:

![{{Work}} {{report}} - presentation]({{imgpath}}131a.png)

The display format enables you to change the way in which your data is presented: you may select as many of these as needed.

The row data and column data select boxes enable you to segment your data by the characteristics of those attending. The options in the drop-down boxes are the select-box fields in user profiles (see section [8.7.0  Other information tabs](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.7.0)). Note that if you select something in the 'Column data' drop-down you will not get a pie chart.

The 'Data to show' options allow you to count your data in different ways.
