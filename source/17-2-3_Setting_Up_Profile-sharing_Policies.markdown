# 17.2.3 <i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Setting Up Profile-sharing Policies

> If you have more than one {{project}} in your system, it is possible to set up policies to dictate which parts of profiles (if any) can be shared, and by whom


If you have more than one {{project}}, it may be that some of the {{people}} will be the same on each. Rather than entering them twice, it is possible to share {{people}} and their profile information across {{project}}s.

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu’.
- Select ‘system administration’ from the sub-menu below.
- In the ‘Manage {{project}}s’ section, click ‘{{Project}} sharing: {{people}} policies’.  You will see the current policies (if any) on this screen.
- Double-click the 'double click to add' label at the bottom of the list and name the new policy. This is what will appear in the drop-down lists that database operators see, so make sure the names are clear. When you have done that, press 'Enter' on your keyboard to save the policy name.
- Click 'add policy details’ below the policy name. A popup window will appear:

![Add Profile-sharing Policy](17.2.3a.png)

The options are:
  - Type of person / Role of person. These relate to the profile type ({{person}}, {{org}}, {{family}}) and role ({{user}}, {{staff}}, {{contact}}, {{funder}}, {{volunteer}}). Making a selection will limit the type of {{people}} or {{org}}s that this policy applies to.
  -	What should people in other {{project}}s be able to do with name and address details? This gives several options for what operators in other {{project}}s can do with shared names and contact details.
  - What should people in other {{project}}s be able to do with custom tab and field data? This gives several options for viewing, adding and editing these shared fields.
  - Database operators with the following role will have the above rights: This lets you specify the role of the database operators to whom this policy will apply - for example, you may not want reception level staff to be able to share profiles.
  - Which {{project}}s to share with? To select more than one, hold down ctrl on your keyboard in Windows, or cmd on a Mac.
  - Make this policy available for use in all {{project}}s? Tick this box to make this policy available across all the {{project}}s in your system.
 

**Please note:** If you edit an existing policy then any changes will also apply to all records which have previously been shared using that policy. For example, if you change the {{project}}s that a policy applies to, all old shared records will be only visible in the new {{project}}s specified. If you do not want this, you can create a new policy.
