3. The search options for Address line 1, Address line 2, Address line 3, Address line 4 and Address line 5 are below
- Exact match - The phrases must be identical, but it is not {{linked case}} sensitive (so &#039;hello&#039; matches &#039;HeLLo&#039;)
- Match anywhere - Will match the entire string wherever it occurs (so &#039;stone lane&#039; matches &#039;15 Stone Lane&#039;, and matches &#039;15
- Starts like - Will match any strings that start with the search string (so &#039;Brighton&#039; will match &#039;Brighton Villas&#039; but not &#039;New Brighton&#039;)
- Is empty - Will show results where the address line is empty (handy for finding missing data)

Also note that:
- Spaces at the beginning and end of address lines are excluded from searches.
- Ward and Borough (if you use the Ordnance Survey look-up and Geo-code): will be populated based on the address details in the contact tab of each profile. You can select more than one ward or borough from each list. To do this, hold down the Ctrl button on your keyboard while you click on the options that you want, e.g. Chichester and Chiltern. To deselect an option, Ctrl click again.

4. OR search any line of address - here you can choose to match your search term to any line of the address with the same search options as above.

5. {{Postcode}} - Here you get an extra option &#039;{{Postcode}} area is (first part)&#039;. This allows you to create an auto {{group}} just based on the first part of a profile&#039;s {{postcode}} e.g. CH41

![28.2 Auto {{Group}}s Address Fields - step 5](28.2 Auto_Lists_Address_Fields_im_5.png)

- When searching by {{postcode}}, you can enter multiple {{postcode}}s (or partial {{postcode}}s) separated by a semi-colon (;). So, if you want profiles living in AB10 or AB11 {{postcode}} areas, enter &#039;AB10;AB11&#039; and select &#039;Starts like&#039; in the drop-down.
- If you want everyone living in a particular town, say, but aren&#039;t sure which address line the town is entered, you can use &#039;OR search any line of address&#039; and that will look in all of them for your search term.
