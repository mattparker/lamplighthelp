# 8.3.0    Profiles

> Every {{person}} has a profile, showing all information about that {{person}} 

Profiles are created for all of the individuals, families or organisations that you store on the database. These might be your {{user}}s, {{staff}}, {{contact}}s, {{funder}}s or other {{org}}s you need to store.

A profile is made up of a series of tabs containing the information you want to store about these {{people}}. You can store different information about the different kinds of {{people}} on the database. So, you can store one set of information for {{user}}s and a different set of information for {{funder}}s or your {{staff}}. For example, you might see presenting needs and medical history for your {{user}}s; CRB information for {{staff}}; and information about application deadlines and criteria for {{funder}}s.

All profiles have a contact information and relationship tabs but any additional tabs will be specified by your organisation. For more information about how to add these tabs see section [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0) .
