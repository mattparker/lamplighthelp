# 33.2.0 Investigating {{Safeguarding concern}}s.

> When a {{safeguarding case}} is raised it should be promptly investigated by a lead investigator

Lamplight assumes that when a {{safeguarding case}} is raised, a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will review the {{safeguarding case}} and then assign it
to one or more {{Safeguarding}} investigators.  The investigators will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}} and be able 
to update it as the investigation proceeds.  {{Safeguarding}} Managers will continue to have access for oversight 
purposes.

Until investigators are assigned, the actions that may be carried out are limited, and in many cases the first 
action will be to assign an investigator. {{Safeguarding}} managers may also assign an initial severity rating,
or make an initial comment for the investigator, based on the preliminary information provided.

Once investigators are assigned they will proceed with their investigation, adding details as they go so that there
is a single , ongoing and up-to-date record of the investigation actions they have carried out.
