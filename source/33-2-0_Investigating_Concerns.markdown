# 33.2.0 Acting on a {{Safeguarding case}}s.

> When a {{safeguarding case}} is raised it should be acted on promptly by a {{safeguarding lead contact}}

Lamplight expects that when a {{safeguarding case}} is raised, a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will review the {{safeguarding case}} and then assign it
to one or more {{safeguarding lead contact}}s.  The {{safeguarding lead contact}}s will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}} and be able 
to update it as it proceeds.  {{Safeguarding}} Managers will continue to have access for oversight purposes.

Until {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned, the actions that may be carried out are limited, and in many cases the first 
action will be to assign an {{safeguarding lead contact}}. {{Safeguarding}} managers may also assign an initial severity rating,
or make an initial comment for the {{safeguarding lead contact}}, based on the preliminary information provided.

Once {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned they will take the matter forward, adding details as they go so that there
is a single, ongoing and up-to-date record of the actions they have carried out.

So, when a {{Safeguarding}} Manager recieves a notification, their first task will be to review the {{safeguarding case}} 
and [assign a {{safeguarding lead contact}}](/help/index/p/33.2.2). You can click the link in the notification email to jump straight to the
{{safeguarding case}}, but new {{safeguarding case}}s are also listed on the dedicated home page tab, 
[the dashboard](/help/index/p/33.5.0), and the [view concerns page](/help/index/p/33.2.1).
