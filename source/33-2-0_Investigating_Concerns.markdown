# 33.2.0 Investigating {{Safeguarding concern}}s.

> When a {{safeguarding case}} is raised it should be promptly investigated by a {{safeguarding lead contact}}

Lamplight assumes that when a {{safeguarding case}} is raised, a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will review the {{safeguarding case}} and then assign it
to one or more {{safeguarding lead contact}}s.  The {{safeguarding lead contact}}s will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}} and be able 
to update it as the investigation proceeds.  {{Safeguarding}} Managers will continue to have access for oversight 
purposes.

Until {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned, the actions that may be carried out are limited, and in many cases the first 
action will be to assign an {{safeguarding lead contact}}. {{Safeguarding}} managers may also assign an initial severity rating,
or make an initial comment for the {{safeguarding lead contact}}, based on the preliminary information provided.

Once {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned they will proceed with their investigation, adding details as they go so that there
is a single , ongoing and up-to-date record of the investigation actions they have carried out.
