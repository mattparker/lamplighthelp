# 52.1.1 How to Add and Edit Locations

> This video is for anyone who needs to add a location to the list that you choose from when entering an {{activity}} record



In system administration it is possible to add locations to the pick-list in {{work}} and other {{activity}} records. You can also edit and delete them in the same place, although this has implications for future reporting. (For more on this see [16.6.0 System Administraton - Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0).)y

Please note, the system admnistration page has been updated since this video was made. The screen that is shown at 1 minute 22 no longer looks like this. You will now need to look for the Locations list in the 'Manage Custom Fields and Dropdown Lists' section, under the '{{Activity}} Records' heading.
