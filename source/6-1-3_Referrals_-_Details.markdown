# 6.1.3    {{Referral}}s - Details

> The details tab allows you to add free text and other information about the {{referral}} 

There are a number of fields in this tab.

- 'Referral direction' is where you can record whether it is a {{referral}} out of your organisation, or if you are receiving a {{referral}} in. You may also be able to show other types of referral, depending on the options in the drop-down list. This can be customised by your System Administrator (for more on this see [16.6.0 System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0)).

As you click inside the {{referral}} reason and {{referral}} notes sections, the rich text editor tools appear. See section [3.8.0  Rich text editor](/help/index/p/3.8.0) for more information about using the rich text editor. 

- The '{{Referral}} reason' is like the headline, and is what will appear in a {{referral}}s table to give you a quick idea of what it is about. 

- The '{{Referral notes' is a place to record any other details that you will need to keep.

- If you have the {{Waiting List}} Module enabled, you will also see a drop-down listing all the current {{waiting list}}s. Select one to add the '{{user}} referred' to the {{waiting list}} from within this {{referral}} record.  

- {{Referral}} success is a place where you can record whether a {{referral}} has been accepted or not. You may see different options in this drop-down - like the '{{Referral}} reason' above, your System Administrator can customise this list. 

When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right. A copy of the {{referral}} record will be saved in the profile of everyone listed on the 'Attendance' (or 'Involving') tab. 

Our 'Creating {{Referral}}s' video shows you how to complete a {{referral}}s record.
