# 14.8.1    Creating {{group}} data views

> Any {{group}} data view may be used with any {{group}}. To set up a new {{group}} data view, go to {{Group}}s->{{Group}} data views->Add on the main menu. 

When you enter the new {{group}} data view screen, you will see the screen below:

**View name tab:** you will first need to give the view a name and description. The name is what you will see mostly, so try and choose something that you will remember what it's for in the future. Both the name and description are required fields and should contain an indication of the options you have selected, the field headings you have chosen to view.

**Contact details tab:** select which contact fields you'd like to see. Please note that if you use this {{group}} data view on a table, the person/organisations name will appear by default, you won't need to select it from here.

**{{User}} fields, {{Staff}} fields, {{Funder}} fields and {{Contact}} tabs:** will let you add some of the fields from the tabs your people/organisation use in profiles. The options within these pages will be unique to your system, as they were set-up and designed by your system administrators.

**Relationships:** allows you to identify the named individual/organisation someone is linked. Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see 'name only' or 'name and contact details'.

**{{Work}} and {{Outcome}}s tabs:** allow for general information (number of records in the last month), but also detailed information. Please note that detailed summary figures can take dates and workareas into account, see the image below.

**{{Referral}}s, {{Comm}}s, {{Eval}}s, {{Grant}}s, {{Linked case}}s tabs:** lets you add summary details about {{referral}}s, {{comm}}s, {{eval}}s, {{grant}}s and {{linked case}}s (if you have those modules enabled).

**Project sharing:** allows you to share the {{group}} data view with other projects, if you are a multi-project set-up and you have access to other projects.

**Blank column(s)** means you can add blank columns to your {{group}} data views, perhaps useful if you are using {{group}} data views for a register and you need a 'signed' column. If you wish to add more than one custom column, separate them by using a semi-colon (;).

Simply select the information you require.

When you have added all the information you wish to see, click the 'save' button in the bottom- right.
