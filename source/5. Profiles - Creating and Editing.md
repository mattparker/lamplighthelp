# 5. Profiles - Creating and Editing

Lamplight can hold details of different types of profiles: the individuals, {{family}} and {{org}}s that you {{work}} with or are involved with in some other way. Each one of these will have its own profile on your system. There are 6 different roles available within Lamplight to use. They can be customised (translated) to match your service so may look different in your system:
- Users are your service users; your main beneficiaries. These can be profiles, {{family}}, {{org}}s, depending on the {{work}} you do.
- {{Staff}} are the profiles who carry out the {{work}} that you do with your beneficiaries. Operators of Lamplight will appear in the {{Staff}} profile {{group}}
- Contacts (External) are the profiles that it is useful for you to have a record of (GPs, Social {{work}}ers, other agencies) and those who you need to communicate with other than your beneficiaries.
- {{Org}}s can be used however you like: you may wish to keep a {{group}} of suppliers, or local schools, for example, or another {{org}} on your system, if you do {{volunteer}} brokerage.
- {{Volunteer}}s are individuals who {{volunteer}} with your {{org}}.
- {{Funder}}s are the individuals or {{org}}s that fund you or to whom you would like to apply for funding.

### Profile Tabs
Each individual and {{org}} has a profile. You may have {{family}} profiles in your system too. The profile holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}, {{org}} or {{family}}.

3. A profile is made up of a series of tabs containing the information you want to store. Many of these tabs are customised to your {{org}}, and every system is different. However, almost all will start with &#039;Contact details&#039;.

4. The first tabs will contain demographic or other {{person}}al information, and the later ones hold information on the activities you do with the individual or {{org}}.

5. Each different type of {{person}} or {{org}} can have their own tabs.
For instance, you can store one set of information for users and a different set of information for {{funder}}s or your {{staff}}. You might see presenting needs and medical history for your users, CRB information for {{staff}}, and information about application deadlines and criteria for {{funder}}.

If you have more than one {{project}}, you can choose whether to share existing tabs and fields, set up new ones for each {{project}}, or have a mixture of both. 

Your System Administrator can add new custom tabs and fields to profiles. (see section 
[104 Custom Tabs and Fields for Profiles](/help/index/p/104)).
