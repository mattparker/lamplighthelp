# 23.2.0 {{Eval}}s Direct: Setting Up a Campaign

> A 'campaign' is the name of a set of {{eval}} requests to invitees, after a training session for example. You may use the same {{eval}} for a number of different campaigns




Before you start, you will need the {{Eval}}s and {{Eval}}s Direct Modules enabled on {{Lamplight}}.  A campaign uses existing {{eval}}s.  If you want to use a new {{eval}} you'll need to set it up using the {{Eval}}s Module (see [22.1.0 Setting up {{Eval}}s](/help/index/p/22.1.0).

### To Set Up {{Eval}}s Direct Campaigns

- In the main menu go to '{{work}} -> DataDirect -> {{eval}} campaigns -> add'.
- You will see a screen like the one below.

![{{Eval}} Direct campaign](23.2.0a.png)

You need to complete each section:
  
#### Campaign Details
   
   - Select {{eval}}: choose the {{eval}} you want to use from the drop-down list.
   - Title for the campaign: choose a title which will allow you to identify it in future. For example, you may have a generic 'training feedback' {{eval}} template, but the campaign title could refer to the specific course (e.g. Health and Safety course May 2011). 
   - Time and date starts and finishes: these define when the campaign will be available online for your invitees to complete. If they try outside of these times they will see a message telling them the campaign is closed.
   - {{Workarea}}: responses will be entered directly into {{Lamplight}} under this {{workarea}}.
   - Do you want to create a separate page for each invitee?: if you leave this option ticked, {{Lamplight}} will create a unique URL (website address) for each invitee.  This means that you will be able to see who has responded, and their answers will be recorded in their profile.  It's good practice to ensure invitees know their responses are not anonymous.  If you untick this box, all invitees will receive the same link, give anonymous replies, and the information will not be saved in individual profiles.
   - Do you want invitees to be able to use their web link more than once?: if you send out individual emails (the box above is ticked) then you can choose whether invitees only have one chance to respond; whether they can send one response, but come back and edit it a later date; or whether they can send in a number of responses at different times.  Remember that people may share the website address with others.  If you do **not** create separate pages for each invitee, then you cannot control whether the link is used more than once.

#### Invitees
   - Select the {{people}} you wish to complete the survey, in the same way that you would for other records ([Adding attendance 7.1.2](/help/index/p/7.1.2).

#### Text and Styling
   
   This tab is where you can customise the appearance, introduction and signoff of the survey.
    - Introductory text appears at the top of the screen before the survey.
    - Text to display at the bottom of the page will be added after the survey.
    - Text to display after the information has been saved will be shown on a new page when the respondent clicks 'save'.
    - Style is the type of font the survey will be shown in: serif is a Times New Roman style font; sans-serif is like Arial.
    - Colour schemes will depend on what has been set up in your system. If your System Administrator has created new ones this is where you will find them.
    - Do you want your logo displayed? If you tick the box, you will need to have one loaded in System Admin for this to work - see [16.17.0 Adding or Changing Your Organisation Logo](/help/index/p/16.17.0).
