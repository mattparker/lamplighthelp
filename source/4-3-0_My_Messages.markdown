# 4.3.0 My {{Message}}s

> Your {{message}}s - reminders, to-dos - are like your post-it notes in {{Lamplight}}, but with dates attached and linked to other information



You can set {{message}}s that will show both in the table in the 'My {{message}}s' tab and also in your diary, so that no appointment or action needs to be missed. 

You can create {{message}}s for yourself, or for anyone else with a profile in {{Lamplight}}. Linking a {{message}} to yourself, another {{person}} or {{organisation}} will mean that it appears in the '{{Message}}s' tab in the profile. If they are a database operator it will also appear in their home page 'My {{message}}s' tab and 'My diary'. 

### To Create a New {{Message}} from the Home Page

- In the 'My {{message}}s' tab, click on the 'add row' button at the right hand end of the any table row.

- A new empty row will appear in the table. It does not matter where in the table it is at this stage, as once you have saved it {{Lamplight}} will re-sort the {{message}}s into date order next time you open the tab.
- Fill in the details that you need directly in the table:
   - Date. Today's date will automatically appear in this column. You can change this to the date on which you want a reminder. as the {{message}} will appear in the calendar on your 'My Diary' page on that date.
   - Time - you can add a specific time for your {{message}}. This is the time that it will show in your diary. If you do not specify, then it will be given a default time of 00.00.

   - Category. When you click on this column you will see a drop-down box of categories. These will be customised for your system (it could be that there are none to choose from yet on your system). Your System Administrator can add and edit these. Choose the one which best fits your {{message}}.
   - Flag. These are usually used to assign the {{message}} a priority. Again, they will be different in each Lamplight system, and your System Administrator can add to and edit them. If you don't know which to use, please ask your System Administrator. 
  - {{Message}} subject. You can put short description of what your {{message}} is in this box.
  - {{Message}}. This box is for a longer description of what the {{message}} involves, and any notes of details that you need to remember.
  - {{Message}} comments. This is another text box, which you can use to make comments on your {{message}}.
  - Date complete. You will not fill this field in at the start. When you have finished your {{message}}, you come back to it in the ''My {{message}}s' tab and enter in the date that it was completed. Remember to save this change (see saving below), then the {{message}} will be moved to the completed {{message}}s list (see below).
  - Link to all attendees. If you are filling this in from the home page tab then you can leave this column blank. If you are filling in a {{message}} from an {{activity}} record (see below), then clicking in this column will give you options:
    - 'attendees' will link the message to everyone who is shown as attending the {{activity}} in the attendance table (for more on this, see [7.1.2 Adding Attendance Details to a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.2)).
    - 'me' will link the {{message}} to you.
    - '{{user}}s' will link the {{message}} to anyone who is shown in the attendance table of the {{activity}} record as being a {{user}}.
  - Link to someone else. Choosing this option will open a search box. Just begin typing the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} that you want to link the {{message}} to, and so long as they have a profile in the system, {{Lamplight}} will find them. You can only link to one profile in this column.
  - View. This will open the {{message}} in a pop-up box so that you can view the details.
  - Save. When you create a new {{message}} or edit an existing one, you must always click on the 'save' box in the same row to keep your changes.
  - Delete. This will delete your {{message}} from the system. Alternatively, if you want to archive your {{message}}, you can fill in the 'Date complete' row (see above).
  - Add. Clicking on the 'add row' button in any row will open up a new line where you can add a {{message}}.
  
### Viewing {{Message}}s

At the bottom right of the screen there are three different buttons. You will only see two of these at any one time, depending which table you are viewing.

- 'View all {{message}}s' will bring up a table of both current and archived {{message}}s. 
- 'View complete {{message}}s' gives you a table of your archived {{message}}s, which have been saved with the 'date complete'.
- 'View current {{message}}s' will take you back to the default list of {{message}}s yet to be completed.

In any of these tables, you can click on the top of any column in the coloured header row to sort the {{message}}s by the information in that column.

### Other Places You Will Find {{Message}}s

{{Message}}s can also be linked to and created from {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{grant}} and {{eval}} records. They appear in a separate tab on the {{work}} etc. record.

Please note, if the {{message}} tab does not appear within records, this is a global setting which your System Administrator can switch on (for more on this see [16.12.2 Global Settings: Data to Store](/help/index/p/16.12.2). 

You can find some information on {{message}}s on the home page tab in our video, 'Homepage Diary and Tabs'.
