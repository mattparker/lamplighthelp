# 4.1.0    Menu Bar

> The menu is the main way that you will navigate around the system. 

You will use the menu bar along the top of the screen to get around the system. 

The first line of menu items (starting with 'Home') can be clicked; this then displays the heading menu for that section. If you click any of these headings a dropdown sub-menu may appear. Simply click on the sub-menu item to go to the page you need.

If you see a black arrow pointing to the right on the sub menu this will mean that there are more options to show. Just click on the arrow to display these.

Throughout this manual you will see 'go to {{work}} -> view all on the main menu'. The arrow -> indicates the {{work}} sub- menu.
