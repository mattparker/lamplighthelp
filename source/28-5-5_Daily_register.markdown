# 28.5.5 The Daily Register

> The Daily Register shows you everyone that's signed in and out of all {{work}} records today - useful for Health and Safety and particularly as a fire register

### Showing the daily register on the home page.

In your personal settings (admin > settings > personal settings) [add the 'Daily register' to your home page widgets](/help/index/p/16.4.1).  Your home page will now show a 'Daily Register' tab which lists everyone attending a {{work}} record today, along with their sign in and out times.

Each attendance is listed, which means that one person may be shown several times if they have attended different {{work}} records.  This is provided to help in the event of an emergency, so you can see when and where they've been.
