# 6.1.1    {{Referral}}s - When and Where

> The When and where tab stores information about when and where the {{referral}} happened. 

On a referral record, it's required to complete the date and {{workarea}} fields on the when and where tab.

When selecting a {{workarea}}, you must select one {{workarea}}, and may select any number of {{subworkarea}}s. To add a {{workarea}}, simply click on the {{workarea}} you require, and then choose the {{subworkarea}}/s.

You can also choose a location if relevant to your referral / organisation.
