# 6.1.1    {{Referral}}s: When and Where

> The 'When and where' tab stores information about when and where the {{referral}} happened. 

The first tab that you come to when creating a {{referral}} record is the 'When and where' tab. 

**The Time and Date**

- {{Lamplight}} will automatically complete these for you with the time and date that you create the record. You need to change these so that they show the actual time of the {{referral}}.
- If the actual time of day does not matter, then you can leave this field as it is. 
- This information can be used for reporting, for example to calculate the number of {{referral}}s in a specific time period.

**{{Workarea}}s**

- The {{workarea}} is a requred field, so you will need to fill one in on every record. 
- You can only choose one {{workarea}}, and once you have done this a {{subworkarea}} menu will pop out. 
- You can choose as many of these as you like.

**Location**

- If they have been set up, you will see a list of locations below the {{workarea}}s.  
- You can select one of these if it is relevant to your {{referral}}/organisation.
