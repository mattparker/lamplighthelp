# 9.2.5    Follow up {{linked case}}

> If you've opened a {{linked case}}, you can follow it up easily by clicking 'follow up {{linked case}}'. The new record will be linked to the old one. 

If a {{work}} record is linked to a {{linked case}}, you can follow it up with another {{work}} record. This will link the new {{work}} record to the same {{linked case}} as the old one. To do so, click 'follow up {{linked case}}' on the context menu.

If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is closed, you cannot follow it up and the option will be disabled.

A popup window will appear allowing you to enter a new {{work}} record. Some of the fields will already be complete, in particular the attendance table, with the same information from the record that you are following up.

When you save this new {{work}} record it will be automatically linked to the {{linked case}}.
