# 6.1.0    Password security

> Some tips for keeping {{Lamplight}} secure. 

Just as the security of your home is dependent on the lock you fit to your front door, so your database is only as secure as the passwords you set. With the amount and level of personal data you will be storing on your database, passwords are vitally important, it is worth remembering and implementing the following when setting your password.

  * Do not write your password down
  * Choose a password that is a mixture of letters and numbers
  * Chose something that is easy for you to remember but difficult for anyone to guess. E.g. the initial letters of your favourite song title.
  * Do not share logins or passwords. 
  * Never save your password to your browser!
  * Always change your password from the first password we send you.

We would also strongly recommend that each time you leave your desk you log off from {{Lamplight}}. This will keep your log in secure and help protect you from any potential 'hot desk' risk.
