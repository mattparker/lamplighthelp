# 24.2.0    Publishing profiles

> With the publishing module you have the opportunity to publish profiles from your {{Lamplight}} database onto a public facing site 

As part of the initial set-up your system administrator will have specified the type of profiles they are happy for {{Lamplight}} to publish and what information should be published from within them (see section [24.5.0  System Administration - publishing module](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.5.0)). It may just be an organisation's name and telephone number, but you could publish a range of other information about them as well.

As database operators you have the ability to specify whether a specific profile is published.

If you wish to publish a {{person}}s profile, you will need to go to their profile (see section [8.1.0  Finding {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.1.0) for information about profiles) and click on the **Publishing** tab. By default, no profiles are published. To publish a profile:

 * double click over the word **no** along from **Currently published (double click to edit)**
  * tick the box and click 'save'
 * refresh the page by clicking on the **Publishing** tab

The profile is now being shared with the public-facing site. The publishing tab within the profile displays the information being shared. Any alterations to the information being published will need to be done from within the tab where that data sits usually, with the exception of the 'Publish summary' field, which you can double-click to alter and save.

If you need to stop this profile being published, double click over **yes** along from **Currently published (double-click to edit) **
