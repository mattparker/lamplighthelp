# 9.6.0 Editing, Deleting and Closing a {{Linked Case}}

> Once you have created a {{linked case}}, it is possible to edit it, close it when it is complete, and also delete in entirely if it was entered in error

The easiest way to carry out these actions is in the {{linked case}} tab on profiles.

### To Edit

- Click on the case that you would like to edit in the list of {{linked case}}s to the left of the screen.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the '{{Linked case}} details'.
- Click on 'edit'.
- This will open up a screen where you can change and add to the details of the {{linked case}}. 
- Click 'save' when finished.

### To Close

- Click on the case that you would like to close in the list of {{linked case}}s to the left of the screen.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the '{{Linked case}} details'.
- Click on 'Close'.
- A dialogue box will open where you can add any final details, and enter in the 'Date closed'. If you do not enter any date in this box, it will default to today's date.

- Click 'close' at the bottom right of the page to confirm your actions.
- Once the {{linked case}} is closed you can't add new records to it without reopening it first. For more on this, please see [9.7.0 Re-opening a Closed {{Linked Case}}](/help/index/p/9.7.0).

### To Delete

Only database operators with a Manager level of access or above will be able to do this. 
- Click on the {{linked case}} that you would like to delete in the list of {{linked case}}s to the left of the screen.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the '{{Linked case}} details'.
- Click on 'Delete'.
- A dialogue box will come up asking if you would like to delete the records linked to the {{linked case}}.

- If you tick this box, then all records which were previously linked to the {{linked case}} will also be deleted, and you cannot get them back. For more on deleted {{work}} records, see [7.2.3 Delete a Work Record](/help/index/p/7.2.3).
- Once you have decided whether you want to just delete the {{linked case}} (when all the records will simply be unlinked again) or the {{linked case}} and all associated records, click the 'confirm delete' button.

### If You Do Not Have the {{Linked Case}}s Tab in Profiles

It is possible to edit and close {{linked case}}s outside the '{{Linked case}}s' tab. To do this:

- Find a record that is linked into the {{linked case}} (in the {{Work}} records tab. 
- Right click on it to get the context menu.
- From that menu you can choose 'Edit {{linked case}}', 'Close {{linked case}}' or 'Delete {{linked case}}'. 
- If closing the {{linked case}} this way, you will not have the chance to edit it or change the date. It will be recorded as closing on today's date. 
- It is not possible to delete {{linked case}}s from here. 
- If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is already closed, you cannot open it, and the option will be disabled.
