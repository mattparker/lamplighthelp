2. On the left of the screen is a {{group}} of widgets you can add to the home page. This determines what shows in your home page, and in what order. Click on a widget to add it. It will then move to the main part of the screen

&#039;Display description&#039; adds a description next to the widget title in the Home page
‘Preferred width on larger screen&#039; allows you to choose how much of the screen you’d like to use on larger monitors. Full width is the default. The options are full width, half width, two thirds and one third
‘Show this widget open by default’. Widgets can display as minimized by default, in which {{linked case}} the user will need to click on them to open, or they can already open when you load the home page
Having all widgets open will extend the time to load the home page. If widgets are minimised they only load when you expand them.
5. Once you have added multiple options, you can use the up and down arrows to the right of each widget in the ‘Selected items’ area of the screen to adjust the order of the {{group}}
