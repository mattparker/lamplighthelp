A payee policy decides who should be charged. It will take the total charge calculated by the charge policy and apportion it between one or more people or organisations. For more on payee policies see section [26.1.1  Overview of charge module rules and policies](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.1.1) and [26.5.0  Creating a payee policy](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.5.0). 

Payee policies are made up of payee rules, in a similar way to charge policies. You need to set up at least one rule before you can create any policies.
