# 14.4.0    {{Staff}} Timesheet {{Report}}

> {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s provide a summary and breakdown of how {{staff}} time is spent, captured through the {{Staff}} Management Module 

Information for {{staff}} timesheet {{reports}} is taken from {{work}} records and non-contact records. 



To run a {{staff}} timesheet {{report}}:
-  On the main menu go to {{report}}s -> more -> {{staff}} timesheet {{report}} 

![{{Staff}} timesheet {{report}} results](184a.png)

- Choose the filters you need as for any {{report}} (for more on this see [13.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1)).
- At the bottom of the page, click 'run {{report}}'.
The {{report}} presentation tab allows you to select how you wish to view the {{report}} data. Once the selection has been made, click 'run {{report}}' in the bottom right hand corner. 

If you wish to show timesheets combined across all {{project}}s, the system administrator can, via the admin menu, make this alteration. Go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings -> {{staff}} module.
