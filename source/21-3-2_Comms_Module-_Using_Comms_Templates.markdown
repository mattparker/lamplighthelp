# 21.3.1 {{Comm}}s Module: Using Create {{Activity}} Templates to save time sending {{comm}}s

> Create {{Activity}} Templates  are partially completed {{comm}}s records that you can use to save time

If you freqently send similar {{comm}}s to people you can set up Create {{Activity}} Templates to save you time. A Template
pre-fills some or all of the fields, allowing you to send standard {{comm}}s quickly.

Here you can see a 'Reminder letter' template from a listing of {{work}} records.

![Creating template {{message}}s](21.3.2a.png)

The templates also appear in the main menu, and can be created for logged {{comm}}s and regular {{comm}}s.

If you use the template from an {{activity}} record the recipients will be the people listed on the {{activity}} record,
and any mail merge fields used for {{work}} records will use the data from that {{work}} record.

When you click to use a template, it doesn't create the {{comm}} directly; it opens up the 'Create {{Comm}}' screen
so that you can check and amend any details if you wish to, and send as normal.

If you don't see any templates, instructions for system administrators to set them up are on [page 16.10.1](/help/index/p/16.10.1)
of the manual.
