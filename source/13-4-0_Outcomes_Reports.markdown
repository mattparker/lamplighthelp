#    13.4.0 {{Outcome}}s {{Report}} Overview

> {{Outcome}} {{report}}s show the impact of your work on your {{user}}s over time

The {{outcome}}s {{report}} summarises the changes experienced over time by your {{user}}s, and recorded in the {{outcome}}s tab. When a {{report}} is run Lamplight amalgamates the responses for each {{outcome}} measure. You can use filters to narrow your {{report}} down, for example choosing one specific measure, who is being reported on, or the dates you are interested in. For more on this, see [13.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1).

### {{Report}} Presentation

**How to Summarise the Data**

There are four options in this drop-down. Each one will give you a different {{report}}.

-	‘Difference between earliest and latest scores’ enables you to report on your {{outcome}} measures, and how they have changed over time. Each {{person}} will need to have had a measure scored at least twice for it to be counted in this {{report}}, as it is showing difference. See [13.4.1 Data Produced When Looking at Change](/help/index/p/13.4.1).
-	‘Count number of ‘yes’ responses’. If you have any {{outcome}} with a yes/no response, you can choose to view the number of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses recorded between the dates that you have specified. See [13.4.2 Data Produced When Looking at Count Yes Responses](/help/index/p/13.4.2).
-	‘Snapshot, view actual scores not change’. This calculates the average score recorded for each measure in the timescale you have chosen, rather than showing the change in it over time. See [13.4.3 Data Produced When Looking at a 'Snapshot'](/help/index/p/13.4.3).
 
**Split Data**

- Split data shows your results split by the field that you choose. The options that you have here will be dictated by the custom fields that you have in profiles.
- You could choose to split by gender, for example. If the options that you have to record gender in your system are 'Male', 'Female' or 'Other', when you run the {{report}} the table will show a separate line for each of the options.

- It is possible to analyse the differences in the impact you are having according to background factors in this way. 
- Take care when analysing data in this way, particularly for fields with a large number of options. The number of people affected may be quite small, so you will need to be careful about the conclusions you draw.
- It is best to use split data with a single {{outcome}} measure rather than a whole category (you can set this in the ‘{{Report}} filters’ tab), otherwise the tables can get cluttered.


**How to Handle Dates**

- {{Outcome}} {{report}}s are different to others in {{Lamplight}} because they measure change. That is why there are an extra two options which enable you to decide how {{Lamplight}} deals with dates.
  - How should {{outcome}}s dated earlier than the 'date from' filter be handled?  
  If you choose 'measure from the earliest {{outcome}} ever recorded', {{Lamplight}} will ignore the 'Date from' on the '{{Report}} filters' tab, and look for the first score for each {{outcome}} in a {{person}}'s records.
  - How should {{outcome}}s dated after than the 'date to' filter be handled?  
  Choosing 'measure from the latest {{outcome}} ever recorded' means that {{Lamplight}} will ignore the 'Date to' on the '{{Report}} filters' page and use the most recent score for each {{outcome}}.
