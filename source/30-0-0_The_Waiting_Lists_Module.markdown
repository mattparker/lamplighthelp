# 30.0.0 The {{Waiting List}}s Module

> The {{Waiting List}} Module enables you to create {{waiting list}}s, manage them and run {{report}}s



A {{waiting list}} is a list of {{people}} or {{org}}s. {{Lamplight}} records when they are added and removed, making it easy for you to keep track of, and report on, waiting times.

Unlike other modules in Lamplight, there is no set up in system administration.

To use {{waiting list}}s you will need to have staff level or above database operator access to the system.
