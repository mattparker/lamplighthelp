> Double-clicking items in a user profile lets you edit just that item. 

In any profile, you can edit a single field by double-clicking on the information that's already there.

Once you have clicked the field will allow you to edit. Click the 'save' button when you're done. Click the tab label to reload the tab content without saving.
