> Double-clicking a field in a user profile lets you edit just that item

In any profile, you can edit a single field by double-clicking on the information that's already there.

Once you have double-clicked the field it will be open to edit. Click the 'save' button when you're done. Click the tab label (for example 'Contact details') to reload the tab content without saving your changes.

To edit all the items in a tab, use the larger 'edit' button on the right-hand-side (see [3.8.1  Standard Controls](/help/index/p/3.8.1)).
