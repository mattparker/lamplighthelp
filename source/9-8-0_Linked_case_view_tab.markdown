# 9.8.0    {{Linked case}} View Tab

> The {{Linked case}} view tab shows details of all the {{linked case}}s a particular {{person}} has been involved in. 

The tab displays a list of all records linked (and not-linked) to a {{linked case}}. To help the page stay 'clutter-free', the initial view only shows unlinked records, and all the available {{linked case}}s which are displayed on a series of buttons down the left-hand side. If you wish to look at a {{linked case}} in greater details, just click on the relevant button:

![{{linked case}} view](217a.png)

When you have done this, you will see a table showing all records linked to the {{linked case}}. You can re-organise the table or view further details, please see section [4.3.0  Tables](/help/index/p/4.3.0) which provides details of how this can be done.
