# 9.8.0  <i class="fas fa-link"></i> {{Linked Case}} View Tab

> The '{{Linked case}} view' tab shows details of all the {{linked case}}s associated with a particular {{person}} or {{org}}



IF you use {{linked case}}s in your system, you will probably have a tab called {{Linked case}} view in profiles. If you do not have this it will either be because it is not selected in your personal settings (for more on this see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2)), or because your System Administrator has chosen not to use this tab. They can switch it on in global settings (see [16.12.3 Global Settings: {{Linked Case}}s](/help/index/p/16.12.3)).

The tab displays a list of all records in {{linked case}}s, as well as those which have not been linked to any {{linked case}}. Each {{linked case}} shows in its own box.

When you open this tab you will see the unlinked records, with all the {{linked case}}s down the left-hand side.

If you wish to look at the details of a {{linked case}}, click on the relevant button.

When you have done this, you will see the {{linked case}} information at the top of the page, with a table showing all records linked to it underneath. 

You can choose the columns that you see in this table by right-clicking on the coloured header. For more on tables in {{Lamplight}}, please see section [3.5.0 Tables](/help/index/p/3.5.0).
