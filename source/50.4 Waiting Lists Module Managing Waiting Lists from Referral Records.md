# 50.4 Waiting {{Group}}s Module Managing Waiting {{Group}}s from {{Referral}} Records

**{{People}} and {{org}}s can be added to {{waiting list}}s from a {{referral}} record**

To add a {{person}} or {{org}} to a {{waiting list}} from a {{referral}} record, open a new {{referral}} record (for more information on this see [10.1 Adding A {{referral}} Record](/help/index/p/10.1)). Fill in the record as usual. 

Towards the bottom of the 'Details' tab, there is an 'Also add this person to a waiting list' option. 

1.Select the {{waiting {{group}}}} you would like to add the profile/s to

The {{person}} that you are adding **must** also be recorded on the 'Attendance' tab as 'Attended' and 'Service user referred' to be added to the {{waiting list}}.

The {{user}} will have been added automatically to the chosen {{waiting list}}.  The date they joined the {{waiting list}} will be the date chosen for the {{referral}} record (in the 'When and where' tab), NOT the date the record was entered into {{Lamplight}}.
