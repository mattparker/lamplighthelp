# 9.5.0    Removing a Link to a {{Linked Case}}

> Records can be 'unlinked' from a {{linked case}}. The record is not deleted. 

To remove the link between a {{work}} record and a {{linked case}}, find the record, right click, and select 'remove link to {{linked case}}' in the context menu.

If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}} this option will be greyed out in the menu. 

If the {{linked case}} is closed, you will need to repoen the case before you can remove the link. To find out how to reopen a case, see [9.7.0 Reopening a Closed {{linked case}}](/help/index/p/9.7.0).
