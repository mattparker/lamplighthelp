# 9.5.0 Removing a Link to a {{Linked Case}}

> Records can be 'unlinked' from a {{linked case}}. The record is will not be deleted



It is possible to remove a record from a {{linked case}}. This removes the link, but does not delete the record. Once the link has been taken away, the record will appear back in the 'Unlinked records' section of the '{{Linked case}} view'tab.

### To remove the link:
- Go to the '{{Linked case}} view' tab in the profile.
- Find the {{linked case}} that the record is currently linked to from the boxes on the left. Click on it to open.
- Find the record that you want to unlink in the table, then either right click on it or left click on the context menu in the left-hand column of the table.

- You will see a pop-up menu. Choose'Remove link to {{linked case}}'.
- If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}} this option will be greyed out in the menu. 
- If the {{linked case}} is closed, you will need to repoen the {{linked case}} before you can remove the link. To find out how to reopen a {{linked case}}, see [9.7.0 Reopening a Closed {{Linked Case}}](/help/index/p/9.7.0).
