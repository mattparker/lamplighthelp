# 32.6.1 Creating an {{activity}} view template using a CodeSet

> Creating a template means that you can produce your report in one click and maintain consistency when you have to 
> run the same report regularly. 

To create a template a system admin will need to go to admin > system administration > manage {{activity}} list
templates.

You'll see any templates you have already created for each type of {{activity}}, which can be edited or deleted, 
or you can create a new one.  Either edit or create a new template and you'll see the following options:


The name of the template appears in the main menu; the description should be a reference to the reporting requirements
and any other supporting information.  You can also lock the template, which prevents other
system admins from changing these settings, although anyone with access to reports will be able to run it.

Work through the tabs setting the filters and additional columns you require.  In the 'Add data columns to your table'
tab you'll find the CodeSets dropdown to select the CodeSet you wish to use.

Once you have created a template, reload Lamplight to return to the home page.  On  the main menu under 
{{activity}}s > view > {{work}} you wil see the template you just created.  Click on the template and you'll jump 
straight to the results.

You may need to show or hide certain columns, or change the order of them.  Having used the template so that you can 
see the results, re-arrange the columns by drag-and-drop and using the column menu, and then 'save table layout'.   Now when
you come to use the template you should see the columns as you need them.
