# 17.2.4 {{Project}} Sharing - Sharing Profiles

> If you have profile-sharing policies you can use them when adding a new profile or in the 'Project sharing' tab 

If you have {{project}} sharing enabled, then when adding a new profile you will see an additional drop-down box: 'Select {{project}} sharing policy'. You will have to select something from this drop-down, but the default option is always 'No sharing'. Please check directly with your System Administrator if you are unsure about which to use.

When you view a profile, you will see a {{project}} sharing tab, which will tell you whether the profile has been shared. If it is not currently being shared, it will look similar to this one:

![profile {{project}} sharing tab - no sharing](234a.png)

To start sharing a profile, choose a policy from the drop-down list and click 'save'.

If a profile is being shared, it will look more like this:

![profile {{project}} sharing tab - sharing](234b.png)

This screen explains who and what is being shared. To stop sharing this profile, tick the 'Revoke project sharing' checkbox and click 'save'. Other {{project}}s will now have now access to this profile.
