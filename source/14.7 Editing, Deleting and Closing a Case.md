# 14.7 Editing, Deleting and Closing a {{Linked case}}

**Once you have created a {{linked case}} it is possible to edit it, close it when it is complete, and also delete it entirely if it was entered in error. The easiest way to carry out these actions is in the {{linked case}} tab on profiles.**

**To Edit**
1. Go to the {{Linked case}} view tab of the profile
