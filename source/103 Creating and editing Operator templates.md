# 103 Creating and editing Operator templates

**Operator templates allow you to specify a variety of settings which will apply to a group of {{people}}. For example, your counselling team may want one group of settings, whereas your {{linked case}}{{work}} team or managers my need another.**

These settings include:
- The colour of Lamplight
- Which sections show on the home page, and in what order
- Dataviews used in headers, My user tabs and other places
- Which tabs show on profiles, and in what order
- What dates to show by default when viewing tables
- Once the template is applied to a group of operators (in Manage Database Operators), the settings automatically for each operator will update each time the template is edited.

The operator template process is split into tabs. You do not need to edit all of them, just choose the parts which apply to the template you are creating.

There is a save button at the bottom of each tab. You don’t need to save until you’ve made all your changes, but if you choose to save each page as you go, you’ll stay on the same page after saving.

To see all your completed Operator templates, click &#039;View all existing templates&#039; at the top of the ‘Operator Templates’ page in system admin
