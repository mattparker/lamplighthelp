# 14.2 Opening a New Case

**You can create a new {{linked case}} either through the '{{Linked Case}} view' tab in a profile, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a {{linked case}}**

It is possible to open a new {{linked case}} in a couple of ways. Whichever you choose will open the same pop-up box where you will complete the details.

### Through the &#039;{{Linked case}} View&#039; Tab

1. Open the profile of the {{person}} whose {{linked case}} you want to view, and click on the &#039;{{linked case}} view&#039; tab

### Completing the New {{Linked Case}} Details
When you have the new {{linked case}} pop-up, you will need to complete the details. These will include the {{linked case}} name, (which is often the name of the {{user}}), the date, and possibly other fields.

1. An editing form will open.

Instead of choosing an existing case from the predicted options, you can also enter the name and details of a new one. (For more on adding records to an existing {{linked case}}

- Add the name, date and category of the {{linked case}}. 
- You may have additional fields to complete. You may come back to edit some of these later or when you are closing the {{linked case}}. For example, in the shot above, we have an 'On completion' drop-down list as we were closing the {{linked case}}. 
- Complete any which are relevant now.  
- You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{linked case}} description'.
- Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the {{linked case}}.
