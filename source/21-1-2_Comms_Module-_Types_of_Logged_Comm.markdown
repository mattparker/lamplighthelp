# 21.1.2 {{Comm}}s Module: Types of Logged {{Comm}}

> Logged {{comm}}s can be flagged by type, which you can change



If you have the {{Comm}}s Module you can log {{comm}}s in your system. When you do this, there will be an area in the record for you to specify the type of {{comm}} (email, letter, SMS etc.) from a list. 

### Add a {{Comm}} Type

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> {{Comm}} Settings' and click on 'Edit types of logged {{comm}}s'.
- Go to the bottom of the list and click in the 'double click to add’ box. 
- This opens a text box where you can add in the name of the {{comm}} type that you want to add. 
- Press enter (the return key) on your keyboard to save. 

### Editing a {{Comm}}s Type

- Double click on the {{comm}} type that you would like to edit.
- The box will change to a text field where you can make your changes. 
- Once you have finished editing press ‘Enter’ (the return key on your keyboard) to save it.

### Deleting a {{Comm}}s Type

- Drag the list item you would like to delete into the grey ‘Drag here to delete’ box at the bottom of the list. 
- The {{comm}} type will appear in the grey box, confirming that it is being deleted.
- If you have just created the list item, you will need to go to the main system administration page then return to the 'Edit types of logged {{comm}}' page before you can delete it.
