# 33.2.1 Viewing all {{safeguarding case}}s

> Any member of staff may view all {{safeguarding case}}s from the main menu: {{activity}} > {{safeguarding}} > view
> {{safeguarding case}}s.

To view all current {{safeguarding case}}s go to {{activity}} > safeguarding > view {{safeguarding case}}s in the main menu. If you are a {{Safeguarding}}
Manager you will see a listing of all current {{safeguarding case}}s, arranged by their status. Status is the stage of the
investigation that the {{safeguarding case}} has reached. New {{safeguarding case}}s are listed at the top, and as you scroll down you will see
{{safeguarding case}}s as they move through the investigation process.

If you are not a safeguarding manager you will only see a very limited summary of each {{safeguarding case}} unless you have been
assigned as an investigator. In this case you will see a more detailed view and be able to click in to see full details
of the {{safeguarding case}}. 

To view more information about the {{safeguarding case}}, click the 'view details' button.

You can filter the view of {{safeguarding case}}s that you see by clicking the 'filter' bar at the top of the screen. This allows you
to filter {{safeguarding case}}s by status or date that the {{safeguarding case}} was raised.
