# 22.2.0    {{Eval}}s Module: Adding and Editing {{Eval}} Responses

> When you have completed {{eval}}s, you will need to enter these into {{Lamplight}}

**Adding Respoinses** 

- Go to {{Work}}-> Add new-> {{Eval}}s
- Click on the {{eval}} you wish to enter information for. 
- The following screen will appear:

![Adding an {{eval}}](117a.png)

- The 'when and where' and 'attendance' tabs are the same as those for {{work}} records and {{outcome}}s (see section [9.1.1  When and where](/help/index//p/9.1.1) and [9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index/p/9.1.2) for more details). 
- If you would like your {{eval}}s to be anonymous you can leave the attendance table blank. However, if you do this you will not be able to view the {{eval}} results in that user's profile, and when running {{report}}s you will not be able to use any demographics from profiles to inform the report. 
- The third tab will be title of your {{eval}}. When you click on this, you will see the questions for this {{eval}}:

- Complete the answers to the questions, and click the 'save' button in the bottom right. You will now see the saved {{eval}}. 


**Editing Responses**

It is possible to edit responses once they have been added:

- Find the {{eval}} you would like to change, either in {{work}}>view>{{eval}}s, or in the profile of a person that it is linked to (you will not be able to do this if the {{eval}} has been answered anonymously).
- Left-click on the menu button to the left, or right-click on the table-row.
- Choose 'edit'.
- This will open up the record for you to alter the details as needed. 
- Click on save to finish.
