# 21.1.3    The {{Comm}}s Module Image Library

> The image library stores images you may wish to use repeatedly (such as logos) in your {{comm}}s and {{comm}} templates. You can find the {{Comm} Module Image library by going to System Administration in the main menu, and choosing 'Admin'.  From here in the 'Manage communication settings' section, choose 'Go to the library'.

Current items in the library are displayed as thumbnails so that you can preview them all.

These are also the images that will appear on the drop-down 'Image library' menu in the text editor when creating {{comm}}s.

The original image is stored in the system and will be used in {{comm}}s. 

**To add and images in the image library**

- In System Administration, go to 'Manage communication settings>Go to library' 
- Click the 'Add library item' button on the left. 
- A popup window will appear: give the image a meaningful name, and select the image on your computer that you wish to upload and use. **Make sure that the item you're adding is the size that you will want it to be when you use it**. You won't be able to resize it within your {{Lamplight}} communication. 
- Click the 'save' button to add it to the library.

- To remove an image from the library, click the small red 'x'.
