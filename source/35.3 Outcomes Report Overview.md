# 35.3 Outcomes Report Overview

The {{outcome}}s {{report}} summarises the changes experienced over time by your {{user}}s, and recorded in the {{outcome}}s tab. When a {{report}} is run Lamplight amalgamates the responses for each {{outcome}} measure to produce a {{report}}.

1. To start, click on &#039;Reports&#039; on the main menu at the top of the screen

![35.3 {{Outcome}}s {{Report}} Overview - step 1](35.3 Outcomes_Report_Overview_im_1.png)

2. In the {{Outcome}} {{report}} box click on &#039;New {{outcome}} {{report}} using your own criteria&#039; or one of the templates if you have already created some for your system. You will be presented with a screen where you can define the parameters of your report.

3. Select a start date and an end date that you want your {{Outcome}}s to have been entered within. This is the date of the earliest {{Outcome}} and the latest {{Outcome}} you are interested in. For {{Outcome}} reporting to work you should have atleast 2 {{Outcome}}s recorded within this specified date range for a {{person}} to be included within the {{Report}} when neasuring any change over time. You can also adjust for this in report presentation, shown later.

4. Click on &#039;Report filters&#039;. Here we can ristrict the {{Outcome}} {{Report}} to specific types of {{Workarea}}, {{Group}}, Attendance type, Role, Profile type, {{Outcome}} Category, or {{Outcome}} measure.For more on this, see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1).

6. Click on &#039;Report presentation&#039; and choose how to display your data. Here you can decide how to display the results of your {{Report}}, let's look at the options available and how they work:

6.1. How to Summarise the Data

There are several options in this drop-down. Each one will give you a different {{report}}.

- ‘Difference between earliest and latest scores’ enables you to report on your {{outcome}} measures, and how they have changed over time. Each {{person}} will need to have had a measure scored at least twice for it to be counted in this {{report}}, as it is showing difference. See [14.4.1 Data Produced When Looking at Change](/help/index/p/14.4.1).
- ‘Count number of ‘yes’ responses’. If you have any {{outcome}} with a yes/no response, you can choose to view the number of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses recorded between the dates that you have specified. See [14.4.2 Data Produced When Looking at Count Yes Responses](/help/index/p/14.4.2).
- ‘Snapshot, view actual scores not change’. This calculates the average score recorded for each measure in the timescale you have chosen, rather than showing the change in it over time. See [14.4.3 Data Produced When Looking at a 'Snapshot'](/help/index/p/14.4.3).
- 'Grouped by number of {{Outcome}} measures with at least two sets of data'. This grouped results by the number of {{Outcomes}} completed by {{people}} and provides information on the degree of change.

6.2. Split data

Split data shows your results split by the field that you choose. The options that you have here will be dictated by the custom fields that you have in profiles.

- You could choose to split by gender, for example. If the options that you have to record gender in your system are 'Male', 'Female' or 'Other', when you run the {{report}} the table will show a separate line for each of the options.
- It is possible to analyse the differences in the impact you are having according to background factors in this way. 
- Take care when analysing data in this way, particularly for fields with a large number of options. The number of people affected may be quite small, so you will need to be careful about the conclusions you draw.
- It is best to use split data with a single {{outcome}} measure rather than a whole category (you can set this in the ‘{{Report}} filters’ tab), otherwise the tables can get cluttered.

6.3. Handling dates

{{Outcome}} {{report}}s are different to others in {{Lamplight}} because they measure change. That is why there are an extra two options which enable you to decide how {{Lamplight}} deals with dates.

  - How should {{outcome}}s dated earlier than the 'date from' filter be handled?  If you choose 'measure from the earliest {{outcome}} ever recorded', {{Lamplight}} will ignore the 'Date from' on the '{{Report}} filters' tab, and look for the first score for each {{outcome}} in a {{person}}'s records.
  - How should {{outcome}}s dated after than the 'date to' filter be handled? Choosing 'measure from the latest {{outcome}} ever recorded' means that {{Lamplight}} will ignore the 'Date to' on the '{{Report}} filters' page and use the most recent score for each {{outcome}}.
