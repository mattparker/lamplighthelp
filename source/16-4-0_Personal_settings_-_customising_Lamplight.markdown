 You can:

  * enter in your 'signature' - the text that is added automatically to the bottom of {{comm}}s. 
  * decide what tabs appear on your homepage, and in what order. 
  * if you have a multi-{{project}} system, choose which {{project}} would be the one which opens first when you log in
  * decide if you wish to use a {{group}} data view as a summary tab. For more information please see section [14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views](/help/index/p/14.8.1) 
  * change the database colour scheme 
  * show or hide menu options
  * choose your preferred view of {{outcome}}s data on the {{outcome}} profile tab
  * decide how accurately you want to record minutes in records - do you need to-the-minute accuracy, or will 15 minute intervals do?

Once changes have been made, always click 'Save' in the bottom right hand corner. To fully refresh and update the system after making changes, click F5 on you keyboard.
