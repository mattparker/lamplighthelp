# 16.4.0    Personal Settings - Customising {{Lamplight}}

> Each database operator has the ability to customise aspects of {{Lamplight}} to fit their work flow. The changes they make will not affect anyone else 

Personal settings can be found at 'admin -> system administration -> Customise {{Lamplight}} -> change my personal settings'.

 For example, you can:

- Enter in your 'signature' (the text that is added automatically to the bottom of {{comm}}s). 
- Decide what tabs appear on your homepage, and in what order. 
- Decide if you wish to use a {{group}} data view as a summary tab or header bar. 
- Change the database colour scheme. 
- Choose your preferred view of {{outcome}}s data on profile '{{Outcome}}s' tabs.
- Decide how accurately you want to record minutes in records - do you need to-the-minute accuracy, or will 15 minute intervals do?
- Choose which {{project}} is the one which opens first when you log in (for multi-{{project}} systems).

Once changes have been made, always click 'Save' in the bottom right hand corner. 
To fully refresh and update the system after making changes, press F5 on your keyboard.
