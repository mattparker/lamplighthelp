# 7.3.1  <i class="fas fa-hammer"></i>  Viewing All {{Work}} Records Using a {{Work}} View Template

> If you often view your {{work}} records and would like to save your filter settings, system administrators can set up activity view templates



If you often view tables of records through the main menu ({{Activity}} -> view) it is possible to save the filters and extra columns that you frequently use as a template.  For example, these could be columns for {{volunteer}}s attending and specific filters like {{workarea}} and dates, so that the table is ready each time you need it. 

Templates need to be set up by System Administrators. For more on how to do this, please see [16.10.0 Creating {{Activity}} List Templates](/help/index/p/16.10.0).

Once you have these in yuour system, they are ready to use:
- Go to '{{Activity}} -> view' on the main menu. 
- The different types of record will be displayed in a list.
- Where there are any {{activity}} view templates set up for that type of record, there will be a small black arrow to the right of the box:

![Records with an {{Activity}} View Template](7.3.1a.png)

- Hover over the black arrow to see the list of available templates:

![{{Activity}} View Template List](7.3.1b.png)

- The top option will always be 'standard listing', which has no additional filters or extra columns.
- Click on the template that you want to run, and it will open for you.
