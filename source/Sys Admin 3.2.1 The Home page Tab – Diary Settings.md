This will add both the team and {{person}}al diaries

2 Adding information to the diary view
As standard, the diary shows a record with times and ‘Summary&#039;. The template boxes let you change this.
The options for what you can add are underneath the template boxes. Copy these into the template boxes to customise your diary.

The codes need to be complete with the curly brackets. Use regular punctuation outside of these brackets to format what you see. For example:
{Summary): {Start_time}
The colon and the space here simply add spacing. If the Summary for this record is “1-1 with Jaz” and the start time is 10:30, it would show in the diary as:
“1-1 with Jaz: 10:30”.

3. The’ Template to use on diary items’ box shows what details will be included in the diary view. The Template to use in the agenda view of the diary box shows which options have been chosen for the Agenda view
If you’re not certain what to do with this, we suggest using the default options.
