# 18.11.0    System Administration - Adding {{project}}s

> Please contact {{Lamplight}} if you wish to add {{project}}s to your system, at [enquiries@{{Lamplight}}db.co.uk](). Each {{project}} incurs an additional charge, depending on the other modules you have. 

Once you have added capacity for additional {{project}}s, you will need to set them up. To set up a new {{project}}, log in as a system administrator and go to system admin -> system administration and click 'Add edit and remove {{project}}s'. You'll see something like the screen below:

![add {{project}}]({{imgpath}}159a.png )

Right-click anywhere on the table, or use the menu button and select 'add new' from the menu. A form will display like the one below.

![add {{project}}2]({{imgpath}}159b.png)

Enter the name, and select all/some of the checkboxes if you want to use any of the same settings in this {{project}} as one of the existing ones. If you want to run reports aggregated across several {{project}}s and do need the same fields, it's better to do this than to enter them again, as {{Lamplight}} can then aggregate more effectively. Click 'save'.

To see the new {{project}} in the main menu, you'll need to press F5 to reload the page. If necessary, you can change {{project}} by clicking admin, hovering over 'change {{project}}' and selecting the {{project}} you want to add operators to. Click F5 to update. The text at the top should update to say your new {{project}} name.

To add new database operators to the new {{project}}, click admin -> system administration and click 'add, edit and remove database operators'. On the table that appears, right-click or use the menu button and select 'add new'. For more information please see section [18.6.0  System Administration - Database operators](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.0).
