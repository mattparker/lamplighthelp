# 43.4 Data Direct: Managing {{Campaign}}s from Profiles

**{{Lamplight}} allows the flexibility for invitees to your campaigns to be managed within their profile**

Invitees for your Data Direct campaigns can be managed from the main menu bar. It is also possible to add your invitees directly from their profile and email them directly.

**To manage an {{eval}} or {{outcome}} campaign from a profile**
1. Search and open the Profile (for more on searching please see section 4.1 Using the Search Function)
2. Click on the &#039;{{Eval}}s&#039; tab in the Profile

4. A pop-up box will appear that will display all the available {{campaign}}s.

It provides an overview of the {{campaign}}: 
- Title, Start and End dates firstly. 
- &#039;Is in this {{campaign}}?&#039; if this is marked as yes, there will already be a URL assigned to them within the {{campaign}}. 
- &#039;Is email template set for {{campaign}}?&#039;, if this is marked as &#039;yes&#039; then an email template has already been created for this {{campaign}} and you can im{{media}}tely send an email to the invitee.

7. To add the {{person}} to the {{campaign}} (if they&#039;re not already), click on &#039;Add profile to {{campaign}}&#039;
This will change the entry on the table within the &#039;Is in this {{campaign}}?&#039; to &#039;yes&#039;
- By selecting this option they’ll be added and the table will update to ‘yes’ - Send an email. This will only be possible if:
  - email is enabled in your system
  - the profile permissions are set in the ‘Contact details’ tab
  - if they’ve been added to the campaign
  - a template email has been already written (click to edit from the menu button to review the wording if unsure)

**  Please note this will immediately send the email**
