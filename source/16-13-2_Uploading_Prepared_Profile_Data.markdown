# 16.13.2 Uploading Prepared Profile Data

> When you have prepared our spreadsheet of profile data you can upload it into {{Lamplight}}

**It is strongly recommended to conduct a test first by uploading a duplicate file with just the first few rows of data.**

Profile data can only be uploaded by a database operator with System Administrator or Project Administrator access.

### Uploading Profile Information

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘File transfer’ section, click ‘Upload profile data into your system.’
- Choose the type and role of the profiles you are importing.
- Give the ‘source’ of your data a name if you choose. This means that if you import often from the exact same format spreadsheet, your previous matching choices are saved for next time. If this is a second import of the same information, select the previous source.
- Click the ‘Browse…’ button and locate the .csv file to be uploaded.
- Click the ‘upload file’ button.
- On the next page will be displayed the fields Lamplight has been able to match, and to what they have been matched. Check these, scrolling right if needed.
- Any fields the system has not been able to match will also be displayed. Check these, correct your spreadsheet as necessary, and restart the upload.

It is important that all the information is matched to a field. If importing to existing profiles, it is essential the profile ID numbers are correctly identified.

### Options

- Validating data: The system will ensure all the data are checked before uploading, and list any records not imported due to invalid data.
- Duplicate data: This will check each name and address for duplicates.
- Titles and suffixes: New titles and suffixes will be added to the lists of available ones (be cautious in case of typos).
- Overwrite existing records: Matches the profile ID numbers in the .csv file to a profile in the system, and overwrites existing information (including blank information) with the new data.

### Upload

- Click ‘upload’. You can now see what the system has done. 
- At this point, it is recommended to open a second browser tab and investigate the imported information. If there is a problem with the upload, return to this tab and click the ‘Undo’ button to remove the imported data. **Once this tab has been closed, the upload can no longer be undone.**
