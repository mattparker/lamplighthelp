# 17.3.3    {{Outcome}} {{report}}s - data produced when looking at 'snapshot'

> Select 'snapshot' just looks at actual {{outcome}} scores, not the differences (ie change) over time. 

If you select 'Snapshot - view actual scores, not change' in the 'How to summarise the data' section of the {{outcome}} {{report}}, you will see a table similar to this:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}} - snapshot results]({{imgpath}}135a.png)

The columns in this table show:

  * {{Outcome}} - the name of the particular {{outcome}}
  * Average score - the average (mean) of all scores recorded.
  * Number of people w. scores - the number of different people who have one or more scores recorded.
 * Max score - the maximum score recorded.
  * Min score - the minimum score recorded
  * Standard deviation of score - an indication of the 'spread' of scores. See section [17.3.1  {{Outcome}} {{report}}s - data produced when looking at change](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.3.1) for more information about the Standard Deviation.
