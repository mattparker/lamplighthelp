# 6.1.0 <i class="fa fa-redo-alt"></i> Adding a {{Referral}} Record

> {{Referral}} records can be added to a {{person}} or {{org}}'s records either in their profile or through the main menu bar



As {{referral}} records usually relate to a single {{user}}, it is easiest to find their profile and open the '{{Referral}}s' tab. Alternatively, you can start a new record by clicking on '{{Activity}}' in the main menu, then choosing 'add new -> {{referral}}'. 

Whichever of these ways you choose, a new record will open in a pop-up window.  

![{{Referral}} Record](6.1.0a.png)

The record is split up into three tabs: 
- [6.1.1 When and Where](/help/index/p/6.1.1).
- [6.1.2 Attendance](/help/index/p/6.1.2).
- [6.1.3 Details](help/index/p/6.1.3).

When you have added all the information that you need to the record, click 'save' in the bottom right of any page.
