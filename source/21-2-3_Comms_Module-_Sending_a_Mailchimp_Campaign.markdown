# 21.2.3 {{Comm}}s Module: Sending a Mailchimp Campaign

> A 'campaign' is an email newsletter linked to a mailing list. You create the content of your campaign within Mailchimp



Mailchimp has its own wizard system which you can use to set up the layout and content of your campaign - see their website for more details. We’ll focus on selecting which {{Lamplight}} {{group}} to which to send the mailing.

### Selecting Your Recipients

- In Mailchimp, go to the  'Campaigns' page (using the menu tab at the top of the page), then click on the ‘Create Campaign’ box to the right.
- Choose a type of campaign (normally email) and give it a name. Click 'Begin'.
- In the following screen, choose 'Add recipients'.
- Choose your audience.  You’ll probably only have one, named for your system which will include all the profiles synced from {{Lamplight}}. Select this.
- In the next drop-down ‘Segment or tag’, choose the option ‘Group or new segment.’

A new section will appear below.  In the drop-down: 
- under ‘Groups’ select ‘Lamplight sync category’ 
- choose the {{group}}s you wish to send to.

If you are sending to more than one {{group}}, make sure that you select ‘one of’ from the second drop-down. If you select ‘all of’ then the campaign will only be sent to people who are in all of the selected lists.

Continue through the wizard to complete the options for your mailing, then send when ready.  We would advise you to send yourself or a colleague a test email to check how it looks on screen. You can then go back to make changes to the campaign as necessary. 

Please [use the Mailchimp Knowledge Base](https://us1.admin.mailchimp.com/support/) if you require further support to create your Campaign.
