# 14.8.0    {{Group}} data views

> {{Group}} data views are a way of selecting the information you wish to view about {{people}}. 

{{Group}} data views are a way of selecting specific pieces of information you want to view about {{people}}. For example, once you have created a {{group}} you may want to be able to view the date each member last attended a session, and their contact details. You can create a {{group}} data view to pull that information from the records in {{Lamplight}} and then show it in table columns next to the names in your {{group}}. This {{group}} data view does not filter the records, it is just for adding detail.

It is best not to create {{group}} data views with too much in them: if you are asking for a lot of information it will need a large table with multiple columns which would be difficult to view.  It would also take longer for {{Lamplight}} to process and show the data. It is  better to create a number of {{group}} data views for different purposes.

To use the {{group}} data views you have created, see section [14.8.2  View {{group}} members using {{group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.2) .
