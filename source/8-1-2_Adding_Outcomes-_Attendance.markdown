# 8.1.2 <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Adding {{Outcome}}s: Attendance

> The 'Attendance' or 'Respondent' tab is where you enter details of who the {{outcome}}(s) involve



The 'Attendance' tab (on some systems this will be called 'Respondent') records details of everyone for whom this {{outcome}} applies.  This is most likely to be a single {{person}}. However, there may be times when you need to enter these in bulk, for example if a group of {{people}} have achieved a training qualification that you wish to record. 

{{Outcome}}s do not need to only be for your {{user}}s - you can add them for anyone who has a profile on the system. 

To add {{people}} to the record:

- Start typing their name in the search box. When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches. 
- If you can't see the name in the list, keep typing until it appears. 
- Click on the name that you are looking for in the list. They will be added to the table.

If {{Lamplight}} does not find the person, please check that they have a profile in the system. It may be possible to add the person to your system at this point. For more on this see [8.1.3 Adding Outcomes: Adding a New Person](/help/index/p/8.1.3).


You can also add members of a {{group}} in bulk: 

- Start typing the name of the {{group}} in the search box and you will see matching {{group}}s too. 
- If you click on a {{group}} the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.

Once you have your participants in the table, you can alter their role or attendance type by clicking on the relevant table cell and making a selection from the drop-down box. Your system administrator can add options to these lists (see section [16.6.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0) ).

To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. 

### Simple Attendance Table
Some systems will use the simple attendance table, which is differentiated by the tab being called 'Respondent'.  This follows the same principle, but only gives you the option to add one {{user}} and one member of {{staff}} or {{volunteer}}.  (The simple setting can be selected in Global settings by your system administrator - for more on this see [16.12.2 Global Settings: Data to Store](/help/index/p/16.12.2).
