# 17.1.2    {{Report}}s across several {{project}}s

> The {{project}}s tab lets you run {{report}}s for several {{project}}s combined. 

If you have access to more than one {{project}} (see section [3.7.0  {{Project}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.7.0) ) you will also see a '{{Project}}s' tab:

![{{Project}} {{report}}ing tab]({{imgpath}}128a.png)

Simply tick the boxes for the {{project}}s you wish to {{report}} on, and {{Lamplight}} will aggregate all {{project}}s into a single {{report}}.

Note that if you use {{group}} or {{workarea}} filters in the previous tab (see section [17.1.1  {{Report}} filters](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1) ) you need to be sure that these groups or {{workarea}}s are shared across all {{project}}s.
