# 28.3.0 Publishing Module: Overview of Publishing Information

> Once you have saved in your system admin settings which determine what information can and cannot be shared with your website, you decide which records to publish on an individual basis

Profile and {{work}} record information is not automatically shared with your website. Your system admin settings give permission to share, but you will need to specify the individual records that you want to publish. This ensures that no data is on your website which you do not want to be there.

For details on how to publish the data to your site see:
- [28.3.1 Publishing Module: Publishing Profiles](/help/index/p/28.3.1).
- [28.3.2 Publishing Module: Publishing {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/28.3.2).
