This view helps managers ensure they stay on top of {{safeguarding case}}s that have been raised, and that they are 
resolved in a timely fashion. The time limits and other parameters used in the dashboard can be set in global settings - 
see [system admin for the {{safeguarding}} module](/en/help/p/33.9.0).

Listings of {{safeguarding case}}s or profiles are clickable, and take you to the relevant profile or {{safeguarding case}}.
