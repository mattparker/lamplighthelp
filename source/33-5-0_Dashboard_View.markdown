# 33.5.0 {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard

> The dashboard view is only available to {{Safeguarding}} Managers and gives an overview of current {{safeguarding case}}s. The parameters of the dashboard can be changed in global settings.

The dashboard shows:

 - The number of {{safeguarding case}}s raised recently
 - The status and severity of current {{safeguarding case}}s
 - Listings of {{safeguarding case}}s that have been under investigation for too long 
 - Staff without current DBS checks

This view helps managers ensure they stay on top of {{safeguarding case}}s that have been raised, and that they are investigated and
resolved in a timely fashion. The time limits used in the dashboard can be set in global settings.

Listings of {{safeguarding case}}s or profiles are clickable to jump to the relevant profile or {{safeguarding case}}.
