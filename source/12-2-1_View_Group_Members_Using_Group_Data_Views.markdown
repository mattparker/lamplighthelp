# 12.2.1 View {{Group}} Members Using {{Group}} Data Views

> You can use data views to see more information about the members of a {{group}}

Once you have set up a data view, you can use it to view any {{group}}. When you open a {{group}} this way, you will get columns of information in a table alongside the {{people}} or {{org}}s who belong to it. 

To open a {{group}} using a data view:

- Go to '{{Group}}s -> view all'.
- Open the context menu to the left of the relevant {{group}}, or right click on the {{group}} in the table.
- Hover over 'View full details'. A menu will slide out to the right of the original context menu showing all the current data views.

- Click on the data view that you want.
- The members of the {{group}} and data columns from the data view will be shown in a table. 

For example, this is a {{group}} shown in pop-up, without a data view:

This is the same {{group}}, viewed with a 'Disabilities, Allergies and Risks' data view.
