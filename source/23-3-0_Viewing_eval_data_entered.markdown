# 23.3.0    Viewing Existing {{Eval}} Records

> Once {{eval}}s have been entered into {{Lamplight}}, you can view them all together, or in the profile of {{people}} and {{org}}s they are linked to 

To view {{eval}}s records, go to {{Work}}-> View all-> {{Eval}}s on the main menu. A list of completed {{eval}}s will be shown. 

This screen is very similar to viewing {{work}} records or {{outcome}}s: see section [9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records](/help/index/p/9.2.0) for more information.

If you have added {{people}} or {{org}}s in the 'attendance' tab of the {{eval}} record you can also view it in the '{{eval}}s' tab on their profile.
