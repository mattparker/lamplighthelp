# 21.3.0 The {{Comm}}s Module - Creating and Logging {{Comm}}s

> If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you have some added options so that you can not only send {{comm}}s, but also log ones which come back to you 

### Creating {{Comms}}

**To see more about creating a new {{comm}}, see [10.1.0 Creating a {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/10.1.0).**

- When you  get to the 'Message content' tab, you will see some added options in the text editor bar:

![Mail merge {{comm}}s](22a.png)

   **People Mail Merge**

   The 'people merge' fields will insert information about the {{people}} that are to receive the {{comm}}. This information is taken from the data in their profile.

   **Document Templates**

   These are standard letters and emails (or parts of them) which are unique to your organisation, that any database operator can use - simply select it from the menu.  
   
   See section [21.1.1  {{Comm}} Templates](/help/index/p/21.1.1) for more information about document templates and how System Adminstrators can set them up.

   **{{Activity}} Merge**

  You can also create a {{comm}} starting from an {{activity}} record ({{work}}, {{referral}} etc). To do this, click on the context menu button next to the relevant record (or right-click on the line in the table), and choose 'Communicate'.  
  
  When you get to the message content, using ''{{Activity}} merge' fields will insert information from the {{activity}} record that you started with, for example the date, start and end times. These fields only work if you create your {{comm}} from the {{activity}} record.
  
   **Image Library**

   Images in this module are saved in the 'library' (see section [21.1.4  {{Comm}}s Module Image Library](/help/index/p/21.1.4)). To insert one image into your {{comm}}, go to the 'Image library' drop-down box and select the one you want from the menu. 

   Once you have inserted an image, you can edit it by double-clicking. This will open a window to alter the size and other characteristics. 


### Logging {{Comm}}s

In some cases you may not want to create a document or email, but may need to record that a {{comm}} has happened - an email received, or a phone call, for example. 

- Go to {{work}} -> {{comm}} -> log on the main menu. 
- A slightly different screen will appear:

![Logging a {{comm}}](89a.png)

- Only the first tab is different: you can record the type of {{comm}}, time and {{workarea}} that it relates to. (It is possible to add types of {{comm}} to this list - for more see [21.1.2 {{Comm}}s Module: Types of Logged {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/21.1.2).
- {{Comm}} logs don't have a duration in {{Lamplight}} so if your {{comm}} took time to complete (e.g. a telephone meeting or writing a detailed letter) then consider capturing it as a {{work}} record instead.
