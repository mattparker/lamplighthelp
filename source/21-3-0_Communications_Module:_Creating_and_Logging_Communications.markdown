# 21-3-0 The Communications Module - Creating and Logging Communications

> If you have the {{comm}}s module, you can still create {{comm}}s in the same way, but there are some added options that you can use. You can also keep a track of {{comm}s which have come back to you by logging them 

### Creating {{Comms}}

To see more about creating a new communication, see XXXXXXXXX.

For those with the Communications Module, you will also be able to use document templates, insert images and use merge fields. When you  get to the 'Message content' tab, you will see some added options in the text editor bar:

![Mail merge {{comm}}s](22a.png)

   **People Mail Merge**

   The 'people merge' fields will insert information about the {{people}} that are to receive the {{comm}}. This information is taken from the data in their profile.

xxxxxx Picture here xxxxxxx

   **Document Templates**

   These are standard letters and emails (or parts of them) that have been set up for the organisation as a whole. To use a template, simply select the name of the template from the menu. See section [18.8.0  {{Comm}} templates](/help/index/p/18.8.0) for more information about document templates and how system adminstrators can set them up.

   **Happen Merge**

  If you have the {{comm}}s module you can create a {{comm}} originating from an activity record ({{work}}, {{referral}} etc). To do this, click on the context menu button next to the relevant record (or right-click on the line in the table), and choose 'Communicate'.  When you get to the message content, using 'Happen merge' fields will insert information from the activity record that you started with.  These fields will only function if you have come to the communication record from the activity record.
  
   **Image Library**

   Images in this module are saved in the 'library' (see section [18.9.0  {{Comm}}s module image library](/help/index/p/18.9.0)) and can be used at any time. To insert an image into your document just go to the 'Image library' drop-down box and select the one you want from the menu. 

   Once you have inserted an image, you can edit it by double-clicking. This will open a window to alter the size and other characteristics. 


### Logging Communications

In some cases you may not want to create a document or email, but may need to record that a {{comm}} has happened - an email received, or a phone call, for example. The {{comm}}s module enables you to log details of {{comm}}s. 

- Go to {{work}} -> {{comm}} -> log on the main menu. 
- A slightly different screen will appear:

![Logging a {{comm}}](89a.png)

- Only the first tab is different: you can record the type, time and {{workarea}} the {{comm}} relates to. (It is possible to add types of {{comm}} to this list - for more see XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
- {{Comm}} logs don't have a duration in {{Lamplight}} so if your {{comm}} took time to complete (e.g. a telephone meeting or writing a detailed letter) then consider capturing it as a {{work}} record instead.
