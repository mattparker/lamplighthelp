# 12.2.2 Using {{Group}} Data Views to Add Information to Attendance Tables

> {{Activity}} records in {{Lamplight}} have attendance tables to show who was involved. When viewing records, you can use data views to create additional columns in the attendance tables to add details such as addresses or demographics

When viewing an existing {{activity}} record, for example {{work}} or {{referral}}, it is possible to use a data view to add columns of information to the attendance table. This can be useful if you want to see contact details so that you can call participants to change arrangements, or to view risk factors of attendees before a session, for example.

If you choose to view {{activity}} records using a data view, the {{people}} attending will be shown in the attendance table as usual, along with whatever extra columns the {{group}} data view contains.

To do this:

- Find an {{activity}} record to view. This could be in {{work}} -> view -> {{work}}, or in a person's profile, for example.
- Right-click the record in the table, or use the menu button to the left of it to open the context menu.
- Hover over 'View full details', and a sub menu appears listing all your {{group}} data views:

- Click on the one that you would like to use. The popup window will then open for you to view the record, and when you scroll down to the attendance table you will see the extra information in the table of attendees.
