### Formatting the Table

- You can choose to sort the table by what is in a column by clicking at the top of a column. Click again to reverse the order. For example, clicking at the top of the '{{Workarea}}' column will sort the records from A-Z based on their {{workarea}}. Clicking again will sort from Z-A.
- The default setting for viewing {{work}} records is 5 to a page but more or less can be viewed at once. User the 'Show' dropdown box to decide how many rows you would like to see at a time. 
- Alternatively you can use the page numbers above the table to move through the records, or the 'Jump to' box to go straight to a specific page number.
- By default, the table will show the date of the record, the name of the {{workarea}}, the summary field, the number of people listed in the attendance table and the number of those attending who were {{users}}. You may also see other columns, depending on whether you use {{linked case}}s, or have any modules. 
- To see other columns that are available to view, click on the coloured header bar of the table. This will bring up the full list, and you can tick and untick one at a time to add and hide columns.

### Searching the Table

Above the table there may be a collapsible search bar. (This is a depends on how you have chosen to set up your system, and is a global setting. To find out more, see [16.12.4 Global Settings: Data Display Options](/help/index/p/16.12.4). This search bar gives more options for filtering the records that you see and adding in additional columns. You can find out more about this search bar in [7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0).

### The Context Menu

Each {{work}} record in the table has a context menu to the left of it. If you can't see these, then you can also bring up the same menu by right clicking on the table row. This menu has a number of options:

- View full details: opens the {{work}} record in a popup window so that you can see all the information on one page.
- Edit: opens the data entry window where you can change the details of the {{work}}, for example add new attendees or follow-up details. (See section [7.1.0  Adding a {{work}} record](/help/index//p/7.1.0) )
- Duplicate: creates an exact copy of the {{work}} record which you can then edit as you like.  This can be useful if you are creating a similar record for a different date.  Be aware this will copy all content, including notes from the 'Details' tab.
- If you use {{linked case}}s in your system you will also see these options (See section [9.0.0  {{Linked case}}s](/help/index//p/9.0.0) for more information):
  - Link to {{linked case}}: allows you to add this {{work}} record to a series of records linked together into a {{linked case}}. 
  - Follow up {{linked case}}: duplicates the {{work}} record, opens the duplicate for edting and saves it in the same {{linked case}}. This is a quick way to create a new record in the same {{linked case}} if it shares details with the original {{work}} record. 
  - Remove link to {{linked case}}: removes this {{work}} record from the {{linked case}} it is attached to.
  - Close {{linked case}}: flags the {{linked case}} as closed.
  - Re open {{linked case}}: will open a {{linked case}} that has previously been closed.
  - View {{linked case}} details: opens a list of {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s that are linked to that {{linked case}}.
  - Edit {{linked case}}: takes you to a screen where you can edit the details of the {{linked case}} itself.
- {{Comm}}: (you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module.) Choosing this option opens the {{comm}}s window (See section [10.0.0  {{Comm}}s](/help/index/p/10.0.0) for more on {{comm}}s) and enters the names of the {{people}} that attended the piece of {{work}} in the 'Recipients' table.
- Delete: this action is only open to database operators with a Manager or Administrator level of access. It removes the {{work}} record from the system, and cannot be undone.
- Add {{outcome}}s: opens the {{outcome}}s data entry window (see section [8.1.0  Adding {{outcome}}s from the Main Menu Bar](/help/index/p/8.1.0) for more on {{outcome}}s). The date, time, {{workarea}} information and {{people}} who attended the piece of {{work}} will be added automatically to the draft {{outcome}}s record.
