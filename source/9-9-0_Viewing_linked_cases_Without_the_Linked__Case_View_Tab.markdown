# 9.9.0    Viewing {{Linked Case}}s Without the Case View Tab

> IF your organisation is using {{linked case}}s, it is possible to view all records in a {{linked case}} even if you do not have a {{linked case}} view tab in profiles. 

When you are viewing records, find a record which is linked to the relevant {{linked case}}, right-click on it and select 'View {{linked case}} details'. You will not see this option if you have a {{linked case}} tab in your system. 

The system administrator can also choose to enable the {{linked case}} view so that it is accessible from within a profile. They will need to go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings and on the '{{cases}}' page tick 'Do you want the {{case}} tab on profiles?'. 

When you open a profile, an extra tab will appear.
