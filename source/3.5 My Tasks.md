# 3.5 My Tasks

**Your {{message}}s - reminders, to-dos - are like your post-it notes in {{Lamplight}}, but with dates attached and linked to other information**

You can set {{message}}s that will show both in the table in the &#039;My {{message}}s&#039; tab, in your profile or when creating an {{activity}} record, so that no appointment or action needs to be missed.

You can create {{message}}s for yourself, or for anyone else with a profile in Lamplight. Linking a {{message}} to yourself, another {{person}} or {{org}} will mean that it appears in the &#039;{{Message}}s&#039; tab in the profile. If they are a database operator it will also appear in their home page &#039;My {{message}}s&#039; tab.

### To Create a New {{Message}} from the Home Page
1. Click on My {{message}}s drop down on the Home page
If My {{message}}s drop down doesn&#039;t show, please ask a System Administrator to update the Database Operator Template [103 Creating and Editing Operator Templates](/help/index/p/103)

![3.5 My {{Message}}s - step 1](3.5_My_Tasks_im_1.png)

2. &#039;My {{message}}s&#039; tab show you all {{message}}s linked to your profile
{{Message}}s are broken down into the following sections:
Today&#039;s {{message}}s
Overdue {{message}}
Tomorrow&#039;s {{message}}s
Future {{message}}

![3.5 My {{Message}}s - step 2](3.5_My_Tasks_im_2.png)

3. Click on Add a new {{message}} button on the right hand side to Add a new {{message}}

![3.5 My {{Message}}s - step 3](3.5_My_Tasks_im_3.png)

4. Complete the form with the details of the {{message}}
   - Category. When you click on this column you will see a drop-down box of categories. These will be customised for your system (it could be that there are none to choose from yet on your system). Your System Administrator can add and edit these. Choose the one which best fits your {{message}}.
   - Flag. These are usually used to assign the {{message}} a priority. Again, they will be different in each Lamplight system, and your System Administrator can add to and edit them. If you don't know which to use, please ask your System Administrator. 
  - {{Message}} subject. You can put short description of what your {{message}} is in this box.
  - {{Message}}. This box is for a longer description of what the {{message}} involves, and any notes of details that you need to remember.
  - {{Message}} comments. This is another text box, which you can use to make comments on your {{message}}.
  - Date complete. You will not fill this field in at the start. When you have finished your {{message}}, you come back to it in the ''My {{message}}s' tab and enter in the date that it was completed. Remember to save this change (see saving below), then the {{message}} will be moved to the completed {{message}}s list (see below).
  - Link to all attendees. If you are filling this in from the home page tab then you can leave this column blank. If you are filling in a {{message}} from an {{activity}} record (see below), then clicking in this column will give you options:
    - 'attendees' will link the message to everyone who is shown as attending the {{activity}} in the attendance table (for more on this, see [7.1.2 Adding Attendance Details to a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.2)).
    - 'me' will link the {{message}} to you.
    - '{{user}}s' will link the {{message}} to anyone who is shown in the attendance table of the {{activity}} record as being a {{user}}.
  - Link to someone else. Choosing this option will open a search box. Just begin typing the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} that you want to link the {{message}} to, and so long as they have a profile in the system, {{Lamplight}} will find them. You can only link to one profile in this column.

### Viewing {{Message}}s
1. In the My {{message}}s tab on the Home page you will be able to view yours {{message}}s which are uncomplete

You can see all {{message}}s linked to the your profile in the table.
To see {{message}}s linked to other profiles, search for their profile, and click on the {{Message}}s tab

![3.5 My {{Message}}s - step 8](3.5_My_Tasks_im_8.png)

4. You can add a new {{message}} and view different {{message}}s on this screen
At the bottom right of the screen there are three different buttons. You will only see two of these at any one time, depending which table you are viewing.
&#039;View all {{message}}s&#039; will bring up a table of both current and archived {{message}}s.
&#039;View complete {{message}}s&#039; gives you a table of your archived {{message}}s, which have been saved with the &#039;date complete&#039;.
&#039;View current {{message}}s&#039; will take you back to the default {{group}} of {{message}}s yet to be completed.
In any of these tables, you can click on the top of any column in the coloured header row to sort the {{message}}s by the information in that column.

- All {{group}}ed: Will link the {{message}} to all profiles in the attendance tab
- Me: Will link the {{message}} to just your profile
- Users {{group}}: Will link the {{message}} to users in the attendance tab
- Someone else: You can search for another profile in Lamplight who isn&#039;t {{group}}ed in the attendance tab that the {{message}} needs to be linked to
