#    12.2.3 Using Data Views to Create Headers and Summary Pages

> You can set up a {{group}} data view to use as a header bar or summary page on profiles 

If there is information about {{people}} or organisations held on {{Lamplight}} that you would like to see at the top of their profiles, or you would like to see data from different profile tabs in a summary page for each profile, you can set up data views to do this. 







More information to be added.
