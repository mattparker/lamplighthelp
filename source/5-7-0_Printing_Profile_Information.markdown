# 5.7.0 Printing Profile Information

> You can choose to print information from individual profiles of a {{group}} of profiles




It is possible to print profile information for specific profiles. This can be done to pdf or to a printer. 

### To Print Details of a Single Profile

- Go to the relevant profile.
- Click the PRINT button on the top right-hand side of the profile.

- This will open a new window.
- On the right hand side of the new window, there is a print menu where you can select the information that you wish to print. 
- Deselect the tabs that you do not wish to provide in the document.

- By default the information from each tab will print on a separate page. If you want to collapse them into a single continuous document tick the 'Print on one page' box towards the bottom of the print menu. 
- You can choose whether to print to paper or pdf by selecting the appropriate option from your print dialogue box.

### To Print Details of Multiple Profiles

- It is possible to use a {{group}} to print details from a number of profiles in one document. 
- Create a {{group}} containing the {{people}} or {{org}}s you need (for more on creating groups see [11.0.0 {{Group}}s](/help/index/p/11.0.0)).
- Once it has been set up, go to '{{group}}s -> view -> view all' and find it in the list.
- Either right-click on the {{group}} or left-click on the menu button to the left of it. 
- Choose 'print' from the context menu.
- This opens up the same print menu as for the individual profile, above. You can select which sections of the profiles you would like to print from here.

Be warned that if you do this for a large {{list}} it will take some time and may slow down Lamplight, as it has to load all information from all tabs for all the profiles in the {{list}}.
