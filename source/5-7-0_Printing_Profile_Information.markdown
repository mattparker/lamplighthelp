# 5.7.0 <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Printing Profile Information

> You can choose to print information from individual profiles of a {{group}} of profiles




It is possible to print profile information for specific profiles. This can be done to pdf or to a printer. 

### To Print Details of a Single Profile

- Go to the relevant profile.
- Click the PRINT button on the top right-hand side of the profile.

- This will open a new window.
- On the right-hand side of the new window, there is a print menu where you can select the information that you wish to print. 
- Deselect the tabs that you do not wish to provide in the document.

- By default, the information from each tab will print on a separate page. If you want to collapse them into a single continuous document tick the 'Print on one page' box towards the bottom of the print menu. 
- You can choose whether to print to paper or pdf by selecting the appropriate option from your print dialogue box.

### To Print Details of Multiple Profiles

- It is possible to use a {{group}} to print details from a number of profiles in one document. 
- Create a {{group}} containing the {{people}} or {{org}}s you need (for more on creating groups see [12.0.0 {{Group}}s](/help/index/p/12.0.0)).
- Once it has been set up, go to '{{group}}s -> view -> view all' and find it in the list.
- Either right-click on the {{group}} or left-click on the menu button to the left of it. 
- Choose 'print' from the context menu.
- This opens the same print menu as for the individual profile, above. You can select which sections of the profiles you would like to print from here.

**Please note:** if you do this for a large {{group}} it will take some time and may slow down Lamplight as it has to load all information from all tabs for all the profiles in the {{group}}.
