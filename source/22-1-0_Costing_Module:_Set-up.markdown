# 22.1.0 Costing Module Set-up

> There are two areas to set up in System Administration to support the adding of expenses to the system: cost status items and cost categories

Configuring these settings needs System Administrator level of access. 

When you add a new {{work}} or other activity record you will see an 'Expenses' tab. There is a table in this tab, and one of the columns is called 'Status'. This allows you to set different categories so that you can see where an expense claim is up to. There is also a column headed 'Category' where you can add categories which allow expenses to be differentiated to help with reporting, for example you might want Travel, Accommodation and Training (how you choose to classify things is up to you.)

Both of these settings are added to, edited and deleted in the same way. 

**To Find Cost Status Items**

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage drop-down lists’ section, locate the sub-section called ‘Manage finance and cost settings’.
- Click ‘cost status items’.
- By default, {{Lamplight}} has three categories - ‘Expense Incurred’, 'Authorised' and 'Paid'. Additional status items can be added to this list. 

**To Find Cost Categories Items**

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage drop-down lists’ section, locate the sub-section called ‘Manage finance and cost settings’.
- Click ‘cost categories’.

**Adding, Editing and Deleting List Items**

   - **Adding a List Item**
   - The final option in the list will always be ‘double-click to add’. Double-click this text to create a new blank list item. 
   - Type the name and save by pressing Enter on your keyboard. 
   - The ‘double click to add’ link will appear again at the bottom of the list.
   
   - **Editing a List Item**
   - Double-click the list item that you would like to edit.
   - This will now be a text field which you can edit. 
   - Once edited, press ‘Enter’ on your keyboard to save it.
   
   - **Deleting a List Item**
   - Click on the item you no longer need and drag it to the grey box at the bottomw which says ‘Drag here to delete’. 
   - The item will appear in the grey box, confirming it is being deleted. 
   **Please note:** It is not possible to delete a list item that has just been created without first leaving the page. If you see the  error message, ‘Unable to delete item’, go back to the system administration menu then return to the editing page.
   
   - ** Changing the List Order**
   - Change the order of the list by left-clicking an item and dragging it to its new position before releasing. 
   - The other options will adjust to make space for it.

**Location Costs**

The costs of using locations can also be calculated if hourly rates are assigned.

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu, then ‘system administration’.
- In the ‘Manage drop-down lists’ section, locate the sub-section called ‘Work and outcomes’.
- Click ‘Locations of activities’.
- Click ‘add contact details’ beside the name of the location.

- Scroll to the bottom of the dialogue box to find the ‘Hourly rate (for internal purposes)’ field.

xxxxxx Picture here xxxxxx

- Put the hourly rate into this field.
- Click the ‘save’ button. 
- Once an hourly rate has been added to a location, whenever the location is used, the costings module will add a cost per hour for its use.

For guidance on how to add, edit or delete locations from the list in the system administration menu, see XXXXXXXXXXXXX. 

**Please note:** Locations are not only used for costing purposes in {{Lamplight}} - your organisation may be using them for diary purposes or to be able to filter your activity information. Please be aware of other uses when thinking about adding, editing or deleting any locations in your system.
