# 28.5 Auto Lists- Work, Referral and Grant Fields

**You can use the information stored in your {{activity}} record fields to search for {{people}} or {{org}}s who have taken part in particular activities, or who have donated in a specific timeframe. For example, {{user}}s who have attended {{work}} sessions in the last 6 months, or {{funder}}s who have donated over a certain amount in the last year**

Each record type within the {{auto group}} setting asks you to firstly select a timeframe (a date range of interest), which in turn creates three periods of time. You can filter on what to happen in each period of time.
- time BEFORE the date range
- time DURING the date range
- time AFTER the date range

With this flexibility you can answer many questions with the same template settings. So you can identify {{list}}s such as:
- those who have attended
- new {{people}}
- those who haven't attended as least 3 times
- who were attending, but have since stopped.

Below we explain some examples of these.

The fields in this tab allow you to filter for {{people}} or {{org}}s based on the {{work}} records in their profile. 
If you want to find {{people}} that have attended sessions based on dates:
- you first need to set the dates,
  - please note that the dates chosen can either be 'fixed' or you can utilise the 'dynamic' date options, such as 'current month'. If you use these date types, when you re-run the list, {{Lamplight}} will know what the present day is and will therefore calculate what the 'current month' is.
- then you need to specify the {{workarea}}(s) you want to filter on (ie. which sessions)
- and select their attendance role/type

You can also choose to find {{people}} that have not attended at certain periods or have been involved in specific records based on any custom tabs you have in your system.

1. **To identify users attending at least one Group session after 1st January 2024 and before 31st December 2024**
- For Date 1 (this will be your &#039;from&#039; date), choose &#039;Fixed date&#039; from the drop-down and select 1st January 2024 as the &#039;value&#039;. Lamplight will include the date that you choose in the search filter.
- For Date 2 (your &#039;to&#039; date) choose &#039;Fixed date&#039; from the drop-down menu, then select 1st January 2025 as the &#039;value&#039;. Lamplight will not include &#039;Date 2&#039; in the search filter, so if you want records to 31st December, you have to enter the following day, 1st January.
- Next go to the &#039;Number of records in profile between date 1 and 2&#039; (the middle line from the next set of three). You are looking for profiles with at least one record between those dates, so choose &#039;At least&#039; on the drop-down, then type &#039;1&#039; in the text box after it.
- You want profiles who went to the sessions, so from the &#039;Attendance type&#039; drop-down box choose &#039;Attended&#039;. This will exclude profiles who are shown in the attendance table as &#039;Booked&#039;, or &#039;For reference&#039;, for example.
- In the drop-down box for &#039;Role&#039;, select &#039;Service User&#039;. This will exclude other attendees, such as {{staff}} or net{{work}} partners.
- Finally, under {{work}} area, choose &#039;Group {{work}}&#039;.

2. **To identify new users of 1 to 1 {{work}} - profiles attending 1 to 1 {{work}} for the first time since 1st January 2024**
- For Date 1 (this will be your &#039;from&#039; date), choose &#039;Fixed date&#039; from the drop-down and select to 1st Jan 2024. Lamplight will include this date in the search filter.
- For Date 2 (your &#039;to&#039; date) choose &#039;Today&#039;. That will filter up to the current day, whenever you run the {{group}}.
- You want to find profiles who have a record between those dates, so go to the &#039;Number of records in profile between date 1 and 2&#039; (the middle line from the next set of three), choose &#039;At least&#039; on the drop-down, then type &#039;1&#039; in the text box after it.
- To narrow it down to profiles who did not attend any {{work}} sessions before that date, go to the line above &#039;Number of records in profile prior to (but not including) date 1&#039;. From the drop-down box, choose &#039;Exactly&#039;, and in the next box enter &#039;0&#039;. This will now only show profiles who did not have any {{work}} records before your start date.
- Underneath that, in the &#039;Attendance&#039; drop-down box choose &#039;Attended&#039;. This will exclude profiles who are shown in the attendance table as &#039;Booked&#039;, or &#039;For reference&#039;, for example.
- In the drop-down box for &#039;Role&#039;, select &#039;Service User&#039;. This will filter out other attendees, such as {{staff}} or net{{work}} partners.
Under {{work}} area, choose &#039;1 to 1 {{work}}&#039;
- If you select multiple {{work}} areas or sub{{work}} areas, Lamplight will include profiles which have been involved in any of them - they do not need to have a record for each of the areas chosen.

3. **To identify service users who have attended between 3 and 5 Peer support group sessions in Q3 2024**
- For Date 1 (this will be your &#039;from&#039; date), choose &#039;Start Quarter 3&#039; from the drop-down, then select &#039;2024&#039; from the box below that.
- For Date 2 (your &#039;to&#039; date), select &#039;End Quarter 3&#039; from the drop-down, then &#039;2024&#039; from the box below that.
- You want to find profiles with records between those dates, so next go to the &#039;Number of records in profile between date 1 and 2&#039; (the middle box from the next set of three). You are looking for profiles with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 records between those dates, so choose &#039;Between&#039; from the drop-down, then type &#039;3&#039; in the next box, and &#039;5&#039; in the second one.
- Next you need to specify that these are profiles who attended, so from the &#039;Attendance type&#039; drop-down box choose &#039;Attended&#039;. This will exclude anyone who was not actually at the session.
- In the drop-down box for &#039;Role&#039;, select &#039;Service User&#039;. This will exclude other attendees, such as {{staff}} or net{{work}} partners.
- Peer support group is a sub{{work}}area, so first select the {{work}} area &#039;Group {{work}}&#039;, then the sub{{work}}area &#039;Peer support group&#039; so that your results do not include all attendees of other {{work}} areas.

4. If you have custom fields in your {{work}}/{{referral}}/{{grant}} records, you will see these as options to filter by at the bottom of the page, under Locations

### {{Referral}} and {{Grant}} Fields
The fields in the {{Referral}} and {{Grant}} tabs function like those in the {{work}} tab, allowing you to search for profiles involved in a {{referral}} or {{grant}} record respectively. You can filter by the dates of records in the profile, as well as using {{work}} areas and custom fields from your {{referral}}s and {{grant}}s.

5. {{Grant}} fields also have the option to filter on {{Grant}} type, {{Grant}} amount and {{Grant}} approval date as standard
