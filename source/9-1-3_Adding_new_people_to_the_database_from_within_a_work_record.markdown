# 9.1.3    Adding new {{people}} to the database from within a {{work}} record

> If you have new people attending, you can create profiles while creating the {{work}} record. 

If you wish to add details of someone who attended who is not already on the database while adding a {{work}} record, you can do. Type in their name in the search box, and if they do not show up on the drop-down menu click the 'add new people to database' button on the right. A popup window will appear asking you to confirm their details:

![Adding a new person while adding a {{work}} record]({{imgpath}}57a.png)

Click the 'save' button on the popup window when you have checked the information.

{{Lamplight}} will double-check whether this {{person}} is already on the system, and tries to check for spelling differences. If there are any {{people}} already on the system who have similar names, they will be shown in another popup window:

![Adding a new person - duplicate checks]({{imgpath}}57b.png)

If you want to use one of these existing {{people}}, click the row of the table in the popup window, and they will be added to the main attendance list. If you are certain that they are not already on the system, click the 'click here' button and they will be added to the main attendance list. A profile will also be created for them, which you will need to go and add any other information to that you know once you have finished the {{work}} record.
