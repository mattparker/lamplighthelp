# 11.4.0    Searching {{outcome}} records

> The search bar at the top of the screen searches records for the text you enter. Alternatively click {{work}}-> view -> {{outcome}}s on the main menu to search by date. 

If you want to search {{outcome}} records using a free text search (for example, to search for text in the 'comments' field), use the search box on the top right-hand corner of your screen. If you type in the text you wish to search for and click the 'Go' button {{Lamplight}} will carry out a full-text search of the system. See section [4.2.0  Menu Search Bar](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.2.0) for more information on full-text searching.
