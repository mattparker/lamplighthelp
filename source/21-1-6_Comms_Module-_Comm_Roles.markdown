# 21.1.6 {{Comm}}s Module: {{Comm}} Roles

> {{Comm}} roles mean that you can assign different roles to {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in {{comm}}s. These are like roles in {{activity}} record attendance tables, and are used to generate advanced mail merges

### Why Use {{Comm}} Roles?

Ordinarily, if you create a mail-merge letter, a copy is created for each recipient listed. Specific details will be added to the document wherever you have a merge field.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to combine data from several profiles into a single document. For example, you may need to write to a parent using contact details from their profile as well as personal details from their child's. Or you may be writing a letter on behalf of a client and their carer. You can use {{comm}} roles in your communication so that {{Lamplight}} knows which profile to look in for each piece of merged information. 

### Creating a {{Comm}} Using {{Comm}}s Roles

- Create the {{comm}} and add recipients as normal, but for each person in the 'recipients' table you should also select the relevant role.

-Towards the bottom of the 'Recipients' tab, choose the 'Produce a single letter, using mail-merge fields based on communication role' option.

- In the 'Message content' section, enter your message content as normal or select the text template you want to use.
- You can add merge fields, using information held in {{Lamplight}} for your {{comm}}. For each field you add from the 'People mail merge' drop down, {{Lamplight}} will ask you which profile you're referring to. For example, if you choose mail merge field '[first name]', you will need to specify who this relates to (in the example below, it could be Staff, Client, Key worker or Legal adviser). This will depend on what roles you have set up in your system.

### Adding, Editing and Deleting {{Comm}} Roles

The process for adding, editing and deleting communication roles is the same as that for [adding types of logged communication](/help/index/p/21.1.5). Click on the link for more details.
