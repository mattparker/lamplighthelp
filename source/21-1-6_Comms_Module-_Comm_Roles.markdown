# 21.1.6 {{Comm}}s Module: {{Comm}} Roles

> {{Comm}} roles mean that you can assign different roles to {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in {{comm}}s. These are like roles in {{activity}} record attendance tables, and are used to generate advanced mail merges

### Why Use {{Comm}} Roles?

Ordinarily, if you create a mail-merge letter, a copy is created for each recipient listed. Specific details will be added to the document wherever you have a merge field.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to combine data from several profiles into a single document. For example, you may need to write to a parent using contact details from their profile as well as personal details from their child's. Or you may be writing a letter on behalf of a client and their carer. You can use {{comm}} roles in your communication so that {{Lamplight}} knows which profile to look in for each piece of merged information. 

### Creating a {{Comm}} Using {{Comm}}s Roles

- Creating the {{comm}} and add recipients as normal but for each person in the 'recipients' table you should also select the relevant role.

- For each merge feild you add, you will need to specify which role it is getting the information from. For example, instead of mail merge fields '[first name]', you would have '[parent first name]' or '[child first name]'.

- In the 'recipients' tab of your {{comm}} record, choose 'Produce a single letter, using mail-merge fields based on {{comm}} role' underneath the recipients' table.

- In the message content section, select the template or enter your message content as normal.  When you add merge fields in the text editor, you will be prompted to select which {{comm}}s role the field is for.
