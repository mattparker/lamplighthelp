# 25.2.2    Managing {{waiting list}}s from a profile

> {{People}} can be added to {{waiting list}}s from their profile 

Within a profile there is a {{Waiting list}} tab. This shows a table of all, if any, of the {{waiting list}}s this {{person}} is currently on.

To add them to a pre-created {{waiting list}}, click on the 'add' button on the right hand side. As the pop-up box appears, tick the {{waiting list}}(s) as appropriate and click to save.

As the table updates, information is entered including today's date. The context menu can be accessed via the menu button (or the right click option) to allow the options to alter, add, view or delete the {{waiting list}} this {{person}} is now a member of. This context menu provides the same options as were described when {{waiting list}}s are managed from the main menu (see section [25.2.0  Managing {{waiting list}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/25.2.0)).
