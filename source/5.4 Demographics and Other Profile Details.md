# 5.4 Editing Demographics and Other Profile Details

**Custom tabs in a profile contain information about {{people}} that's unlikely to change often, for example demographic details. The information you put in here can be overwritten as necessary**

{{Lamplight}} allows you to add as many tabs and fields as you need to in order to record your information. Custom tabs are unique to your organisation and contain information that your organisation needs for its work and reporting. 

Go to the profile of the relevant {{person}} or {{org}}. For more on how to search for a profile, please see [4.1 Using The Search Function](/help/index/p/4.1).

- Plain text area - a box which lets you enter a short amount of free text.
- Plain text box - a larger area to enter longer amounts of free text.

- Check box - click on the box to fill in a tick.
- Radio button - click on the button to indicate a yes.
- Dates - dates are entered in UK format by selecting from the day/month/year select boxes, or you can use the pop-up calendar to find the date.
- Times - times are entered on a 24-hour clock from select boxes.
- Number box - {{Lamplight}} will only accept numbers in this box - no text, spaces or other characters.
- Charity number look-up - allows the charity number of an organisation to be entered, along with a link to their page on the Charity Commission website.

If the option you need is not there, speak to your System Administrator about what needs to be added. If you have the appropriate permission levels, see section [104 Custom tabs and fields for profiles](/help/index/p/104).
