# 30.1.0 {{Waiting List}}s Module: Create a New {{Waiting List}}

> You can create as many {{waiting list}}s as you need to cover different situations



Creating a new {{waiting list}} is like adding a record in {{Lamplight}}.

- In the main menu, choose ‘{{activity}} -> add new -> {{waiting list}}’.

 -This will open a new page with several tabs. 

![New {{Waiting List}} Record](30.1.0b.png)

**{{Waiting List}} Name**
  
- Provide your list with a clear and full name and description. This is what database operators will see when they choose which list to add someone to, so the clearer the better.
   
**{{Waiting List}} Members**
   
- If you want to, you can add {{people}} to the {{waiting list}} as you create it. This isn’t necessary as you can just set up the initial structure and add people later.
   - To add {{people}} to the list use the search box in the top middle of the page to add names, or {{group}} names.
   - If you realise someone has been added in error, click on the red cross which will remove them from this list. 

**Removal**
   
- You can choose to remove {{people}} automatically from a {{waiting list}} if they attend a particular {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}}, or a {{referral}} record.  

- {{Work}} Record Auto-removal
   - To activate auto-removal based on a {{work}} records, select the checkbox titled ‘Remove people from {{waiting list}} automatically when they attend a {{work}} record’. 
   - Choose the {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}}s to which this applies. You can select more than one {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}}.    - **If you are choosing {{subworkarea}}s be sure to deselect the {{workarea}} associated with it, or Lamplight will continue to apply deselection to the whole {{workarea}}.**
   - If you choose not to select a {{workarea}} at this point, the people on the {{waiting list}} will be automatically removed when they 'attend’ any {{work}} record.

- {{Referral}} Record Auto-removal
   - Tick the ‘Remove people from {{waiting list}} automatically when they attend a {{referral}} record?’ box. 
   - This will remove them from the list when they are involved in any {{referral}} record as a '{{user}} referred'. This applies whether it is a {{referral}} ‘in’ to you or a {{referral}} out. 

**Alerts**
   
- You can choose to alert a database operator when someone has been on the {{waiting list}} for more than a specfied number of days, weeks, months or years. The alert takes the form of a notice in their ‘Diary’ page.
   - In the field starting ‘Alert me when…’, select days, weeks, months or years from the dropdown, and then add the appropriate number in the box. For example, if you select months and then enter ‘6’, it will alert you after six months.
   - Choose which database operator will receive the alert from the drop-down box.

**Target Time for Someone to be Removed**

- You can set a target time by which people should have been removed from the {{waiting list}}. 
- Once a person has passed this target time they will be shown in red on the {{waiting list}}. 
   - Choose from ‘days, weeks, months, years’ in the drop-down list.
   - Enter the appropriate number in the text box, as for the previous section.
 
**{{Project}} Sharing**
 
- If you have multiple {{Lamplight}} {{project}}s, you’ll see an additional ‘{{Project}} sharing’ tab. You can choose here which {{project}}s this {{waiting list}} will be available for. 
- It’s important to note that although different {{project}}s will be able to use this list when shared, each {{project}} will have its own list, and the names in the list will not be shared aross {{project}}s.
   
   
When all the information has been added, click the 'save' button on the bottom right hand corner. You have now created your new {{waiting list}}.
