- Edit waiting: Database operators with a Manager level of access or above will be given the option to edit the {{waiting {{group}}}} (this option is visible in grey text and cannot be selected by operators with a lower access level.) Section about editing from here bulk updating {{group}}s!
- Duplicate {{group}}: will create a direct copy of the {{waiting {{group}}}}
  - The new {{waiting list}} will appear in the table with the same name as the original one, plus the word 'copy' at the end.
  - You should use the context menu again to edit this record, changing the name and any details which are different to your existing group.  **Be aware that copying a {{waiting list}} includes the {{waiting list}} members. To remove them from your new record, go to the '{{Waiting list}} members' tab and click on the red cross in the table to the right of anyone who should not be there.**

- {{Comm}} with {{group}}: This will open a comms record
- Create email to {{group}}: This will open an email communication
- View Mailchimp Status: If you have the {{Comm}}s Module and are linked to Mailchimp it is possible to sync the members of the {{waiting list}}. This means that you could send out a Mailchimp communication to all of them.
- Click on Print {{group}} member profiles: This will open a print screen in a new tab. You can choose what to print about the included profiles from the print menu.
    -  **Be careful** doing this with a large {{waiting list}} as the complete profile
information for each member of the {{waiting list}} will be downloaded
- Delete {{waiting {{group}}}}: You need to have an access level of Manager, System or Project Administrator to delete {{waiting list}}s. 
  - If you choose to 'Delete {{waiting list}}' this is permanent and it is not possible to undo. It will delete the {{waiting list}} and remove everyone that was on it, but it does not delete the profiles of members.

**My user restrictions**

If the ['my user' restriction](/help/index/p/114.6) is enabled, operators affected will not be able to edit {{waiting list}}s directly.
