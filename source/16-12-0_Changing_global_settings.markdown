# 16.12.0    Changing Global Settings

> Global settings allow you to make decisions about what information you want to capture and how you want to capture it. System Administrators can customise the system through the admin menu option 'Change global settings'. 


Global settings in Lamplight affect every database operator, and control how the system behaves, which options are available to all users, and how information is displayed.

Settings affecting each database operator individually are found in personal settings.

To access global settings, you need System Administrator privileges. From the top menu bar choose admin> system administration> Customise Lamplight, and select ‘change global settings’.
