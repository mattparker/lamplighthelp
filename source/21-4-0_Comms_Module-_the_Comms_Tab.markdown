# 21.4.0  {{Comm}}s Module: The {{Comm}}s Tab

> If you have the {{Comm}}s Module then you will also see a {{Comm}} tab in profiles. This shows a record of all the {{comm}}s you've had with this {{person}} or {{org}}



The {{comm}}s tab is the log of all {{comm}}s for the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile you are looking at.

### Viewing and Editing {{Comm}}s

If you want to look at details of a {{comm}} record, the following options are available in the context menu (you can see this by clicking on the menu to the left of the relevant {{comm}}, or right clicking the table row):

![{{Comm}}s Context Menu](21.4.0a.png)

- View full details: opens the details of the {{comm}} including any attached files.
- Edit: opens the data entry window where you can change the details of some {{comm}}s (see section [10.1.0 Creating a {{comm}}](/help/index/p/10.1.0)).
- Delete: archives the {{comm}}. You can still see it by selecting 'Show deleted records' from the search bar above the table of {{comm}}s.

If you are using {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see the following options:

- Link to {{linked case}}: allows you to add this {{comm}} to a {{linked case}}. (See section [9.0.0 {{Linked case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0) for more.)
- Remove link to {{linked case}}: if a {{comm}} is already attached to a {{linked case}}, this option will remove again. It will not delete the record.
- Close {{linked case}}: flags the {{linked case}} which the record is attached to as closed.
- Re-open {{linked case}}: will re-open a {{linked case}} which the record is attached to if it has previously been closed. If the {{linked case}} is still open, this option will be greyed out.
- View {{linked case}} details: takes you to a screen to see the details of the {{linked case}}.
- Edit {{linked case}}: allows you to edit the details of the {{linked case}} rather than the record.

### Creating and Logging {{Comm}}s

You can also create or log a new {{comm}} for the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile you are in by clicking the 'Create {{comm}}' or 'Log {{comm}}' buttons in the top or bottom right hand corner (see sections [10.1.0  Creating a {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/10.1.0) and [21.3.0  {{Comm}}s Module: Logging a {{Comm}}](/help/index/p/21.3.0) for more).
