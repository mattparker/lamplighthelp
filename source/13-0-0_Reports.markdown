# 13.0.0 {{Report}}s

> {{Report}}s in {{Lamplight}} give answers to 'how many' type questions, giving numerical summaries of the work that's been done and the  impact it's had

{{Report}}s in {{Lamplight}} show numerical summaries of the data held in the system. This could be of the work you have done, the impact you've had or funding that you have received, for example. 

There is a great deal of flexibility in how you filter and present the information. There are some aspects of {{report}}s which are common to all (or most) (see [13.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/13.1.1), and some that are specific to each different one.

Please note that you need to have Staff, Manager, System Administrator or Reporter database operator level to view and run {{report}}s. 

To set up and view {{report}}s:
- Click '{{Report}}s' on the main menu. 
- Click on the name of the {{report}} that you want on the menu bar (if you can't immediately see it, click the 'more' option).

### Core {{Report}}s 

**All systems will have these so long as they are activated in global settings.**
- {{Work}} {{report}}s count the number of {{people}} you've worked with, time taken and attendances (see [13.3.0 {{Work}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.3.0)).
- {{Outcome}} {{report}}s show the impact of your work, and the average changes that have been seen (see [13.4.0 {{Outcome}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.4.0)).
- {{Referral}} {{report}}s count and summarise the {{referral}}s that have occurred within any time frame (see [13.5.0 {{Referral}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/13.5.0)).
- {{Linked case}} {{report}}s provide a summary of the records in {{linked case}}s, and allow analysis of open and closed {{linked case}}s within any time period (see [13.6.0 {{Linked Case}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.6.0)).
- {{Grant}} {{report}}s show summary data on the {{grant}}s you've entered onto {{funder}} profiles (see [13.7.0 {{Grant}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.7.0)). 
  
### Module {{Report}}s 

**You will only see these on your system if you have the module.**
- {{Comm}} {{report}}s count and present information on {{comm}}s made (see [14.1.0 {{Comm}} {{Report}}s](help/index/p/14.1.0)).
- {{Eval}} {{report}}s summarise responses to {{eval}} questionnaires (see [14.2.0 {{Eval}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/14.2.0)).
- {{Match}} {{report}}s show the number of matches and opportunities registered and requested, and the number of different people involved (see [14.3.0 {{Match}} Module {{Report}}](help/index/p/14.3.0)).
- {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s breakdown how {{staff}}/{{volunteer}} time is spent, captured via the {{Staff}} Management Module (see [14.4.0 Staff Timesheet Report](help/index/p/14.4.0)).
- {{Waiting list}} {{report}}s show the numbers of {{people}} on {{waiting list}}s, and the average waiting time for each (see [14.5.0 {{Waiting List}} {{Report}}s]((help/index/p/14.5.0)).
