# 13.0.0    {{Report}}s

> {{Report}}s in {{Lamplight}} show numerical summaries of the data held in the system. Different {{report}}s in {{Lamplight}} pull data from different types of record

{{Report}}s in {{Lamplight}} show numerical summaries of the data held in the system. This could be of the work you have done, or the impact you've had. 

There is a great deal of flexibility in how you filter and present the information. There are some aspects of {{report}}s which are common to all (or most) {{report}}s, and some that are specific to different {{report}}s.

Please note that you need to have Staff, Manager, System Administrator or Reporter access rights to view and run reports. 

To set up and view {{report}}s, click '{{Report}}s' on the main menu and click on the {{report}} you want to view.

**Core {{report}}s** (All systems will have these so long as they are activated in global settings) 

  * {{Work}} {{report}}s count the number of {{people}} you've worked with, in different ways.
  * {{Outcome}} {{report}}s show the impact of your work: on average, what changes have been seen.
