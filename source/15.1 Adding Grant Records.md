# 15.1 Adding Grant Records

As with {{work}} and {{referral}} records, a {{grant}} record can either be added through a profile or by opening a new record via the main menu bar

There are two places that you can open a new record from. 
- If your {{grant}} record relates to a single {{org}} or person, it is easiest to open their profile in {{Lamplight}}, click on the '{{Grant}}s' tab to open it, then click 'Add' on the right-hand side of that page. 
- You can also open a new record from the Activity tab from the main menu.

### To Add a {{grant}} record from the Activity tab
1. Click on &#039;Activities&#039; in the top menu bar
