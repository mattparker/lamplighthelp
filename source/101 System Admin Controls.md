# 101 System Admin Controls

**System administration allows you to set up and change the settings on your {{Lamplight}} system. This is where you can alter drop-down lists, add new database operators, and manage many other aspects of your system**

{{Lamplight}} database operators with a System or Project Administrator level of access have permission to make many changes in Lamplight. If you do not have this level of access, you will see a more limited range of options in system administration. 

To view system admin:

1. Click on your initials in the top right corner

The main functions that an administrator can perform are:

- Adding new database operators to the system, assigning the appropriate user level and deleting them where necessary (see [102 Database Operators](/help/index/p/102)).
- Add new operator templates (see [103 Creating and Editing Operator Templates](/help/index/p/103)).
- Adding to or changing the drop-down lists that appear in {{Lamplight}} in profiles and records (see [104 Custom Tabs and Fields for Profiles](/help/index/p/104)).
- Creating new custom tabs and fields on profiles and records (see [104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/104.2)).
- Managing security, such as setting login and password policies for users (see [120.2 Login Security Policies](/help/index/p/120.2)).
- Turning features - such as {{message}}s and {{linked case}}s - on and off in global settings (see [114 System Admin - Global Settinggs](/help/index/p/114)).
- Creating {{report}} and {{activity}} templates that are available to all users (see [113.1 Creating {{Report}} Templates](/help/index/p/113.1) and [113.2 {{Activity}} Record Table Templates](/help/index/p/113.2)).
- Uploading profile data (see [109 Profiles - Uploading Profile Data to Lamplight {{Lamplight}} (Sys  Admin)](/help/index/p/109)).
- Data management, including merging and permanently deleting profiles (see [108 Profiles - Merging, Archiving, Deleting and Restricted Processing](/help/index/p/108)).
