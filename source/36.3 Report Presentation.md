# 36.3 Report Presentation

Once you have added the filters for your {{report}}, you can use the {{report}} presentation to show the data in different ways

1. When you create a new {{report}}, the &#039;{{Report}} presentation&#039; drop down is the last one on the page

**Show Data for All Fields in Tab**
3. Click on the drop down Show data for all fields in tab, this will show you all available custom profile tabs, for {{user}}s, and all other profile types. 

You can choose to break down your results using a custom profile tab, with a separate table for each of the fields. For instance, if you have a ‘Personal’ Tab that captures demographic data, you could select that.

4. Click on run {{report}}
5. When you run the {{report}}, Lamplight will produce a table for each field in your &#039;Personal&#039; tab (or whichever tab you choose). You can see below that we have results for &#039;Gender&#039; and &#039;Ethnicity&#039;

**Row Data**

The row and column data drop-down lists give you the chance to specify exactly what you want to see in your table.  When you specify row data and run the {{report}}, {{Lamplight}} will present the information split into rows by the field that you have chosen. You can break things down by everything from {{workarea}}, a single demographic options to Day of the week.

For example, if you choose to sort the rows by what field you would like to see represented in the rows of your table, you could choose to show your results by 'Day of the week':

6. Select Day of the week from Row data

7. Then your table will look like this:

**Column Data**

In the example above, columns in the table are used to show what we call 'Summary data'. This gives you multiple data options for Row data chosen. You can choose to replace this 'Summary data' with another single pice of data which you choose in the 'Column data' drop-down.

You can also use this to find more detail on your row data. This will create a single, more focused table.

8. Select something in 'Data to show'

**Data to show options**

- If you select something in 'Column data' without changing the 'Summary data' options directly below, then your report will not work. (It will run, but not give you the data you neeed.
- Choose one of the options from the 'Data to show' list. For example, Number of profile, number of attendances or total length of {{work}} record.

9. In the example below we choose &#039;{{workarea}}&#039; to show in row data, while the column data we choose is &#039;Day of the week&#039;. In Data to display we have chosen to show the number of different {{people}}, which means all the number we see below are the unique number of people in each section.
