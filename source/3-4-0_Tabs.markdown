# 3.4.0    Tabs

> When you see a tab in {{Lamplight}}, click on it to see the information held there



Many of the screens in {{Lamplight}} use tabs. For example you will see them along the top of a profile:

![Profile tab view in {{Lamplight}}](26a.png)

Or when you are creating a {{report}}:

![{{Report}} tab view in {{Lamplight}}](3.4.0a.PNG)

Click on a tab to open it and view the information held there. 

The current tab is always in a different colour, for example the current profile tab is darker than the others, while the current {{report}} tab is white.
