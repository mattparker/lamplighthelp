# 28.1.2    {{Staff}} Management Module: List Options

> You can make alterations to the content of the dropdown lists within the {{staff}} management module. This relates to the lists you will choose from in training, appraisal and absence records

You need System or Project Administrator level access to be able to add to these lists. 

Go to the System Administration menu by clicking on Admin in the main menu, and then choosing ‘System Administration’ in the menu bar itself. You’ll see a new section under ‘Manage drop-down lists’ called ‘Staff module’.

You'll want to work through all the options to add list categories. 

### Dealing with lists

   - **Adding a new category**
   To add a new option to any list, find the box at the bottom of the column titled ‘double click to add’. By double clicking on this text you’ll open a blank box where you can enter your new category. Once you’ve done this, save it by pressing enter on your keyboard. The text box will close and a new ‘double-click to add’ option will appear again at the bottom of the list (ready for you to add a new option if required).
 
   - **Editing**
   You can edit an existing category simply by double clicking over the text. 
Once you’re done editing, simply click ‘enter’ on your keyboard, and you’ll see it save.

   - **Changing the list order**
   You can change the order of list of categories by dragging and dropping. Left click and hold on the item you wish to move and drag it with your mouse to its new position. You’ll see the other options adjust to make space for it. Once it’s in the correct place, release the mouse button. 
   
   - **Deleting a list item**
Underneath your list of categories, you’ll see a grey rectangle with ‘Drag here to delete’ written in it. If you want to remove a list item, you can simply click and drag the box that it is in over the grey box. When you let go, you’ll see the option you deleted appear in the grey box.
