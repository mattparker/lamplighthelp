# 10.2 {{Comm}}s Module: Added Functionality

> It is possible to do more with {{comm}}s in {{Lamplight}}, such as logging {{comm}}s in profiles, and connecting to Mailchimp. To do this you will need the {{Comm}}s {{Module}}

The core system already comes with a host of communications features, but you may need more. The {{Comm}}s Module takes the core features further. In addition to mail merge, email, and letter writing you will now have much greater versatility with your {{comm}}s. 

- **{{Comm}}s Logging**

   - View {{comm}}s sent.
   - Upload additional documents to case file.
   - Log {{comm}}s received.

- **{{Comm}} Reports**

   - Report of how many people received a mailing.
   - Link {{comm}}s reporting to attendance and outcomes.

- **Images and Templates**

   - Set up templates for regular mailings (newsletters/bookings/certificates etc).
   - Store a library of images for use in {{comm}}s.
   - Use your own signature and headed paper.
   
- **Send and Log SMS Messages**
  
   - You can buy text credits and send out SMS messages which are logged in the system.
