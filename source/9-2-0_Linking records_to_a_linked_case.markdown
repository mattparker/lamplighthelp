# 9.2.0    Linking Records to a {{Linked Case}}

> You can link existing records to a case in two ways, either through the context menu, or by dragging and dropping them in a table. 

To link a {{work}} or other record to an existing {{linked case}}, click 'link to {{linked case}}' on the context menu. This will open up a dialogue box where you can start typing the name of the case to find the one that you need. 

Alternatively you can click on the context menu next to any activities record (or right click on the record in a table), and choose the option 'link to {{linked case}}. This will open the same dialogue box as mentioned above. 

If a record is already linked to a {{linked case}}, you cannot link it to another. The 'link to {{linked case}}' option will be disabled (grey text). You will need to remove the link to the existing {{linked case}} first (see section [9.9.0  Removing a link to a {{linked case}}](/help/index//p/9.5.0) ).

You also cannot link a record to a {{linked case}} which has been closed. In this instance you will need to re-open the {{linked case}} before you can attach the record. For information on this, (see section [9.7.0 Re-opening a closed {{linked case}}](/help/index//p/9.7.0)).

Once a record is linked to a {{linked case}} it appears in the '{{linked case}} view' tab, within the {{case}} that it is linked to. It also continues to appear in its appropriate tab, for example the {{work}} records tab.
