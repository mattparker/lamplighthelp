# 16.4.2 <i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Personal Settings - Profiles

> This section allows you to customise how information is displayed when you are looking at a profile, for example setting up a summary tab, header bars, and deciding the tabs you can see and which order they are in


There are a number of settings which use {{group}} data views to display information. For more on what these are and how to set them up, see [13.0.0 {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/13).

### {{Group}} Data View to Use as Summary Tab on Profiles

   This will add a summary tab to the beginning of a profile. The data view that you choose from the drop-down list will decide what information is displayed here.

### {{Group}} Data View to Use in Heading on Profiles (Default)
   When you specify a data view from this drop-down list, {{Lamplight}} will add a header bar to the top of each profile. This shows the information specified in your chosen data view (in this example role, first name, surname and starting date) underneath the profile name.

   For more on creating a header bar, see [13.2.3 Using a Data View to Create Headers](/help/index/p/13.2.3).

### {{Group}} Data View to Use… (Various Options)

   If you would like to vary the header you see depending on the type of profile you’re looking at (staff, service user, volunteer, donor etc.), the different options shown here each relates to a separate profile type. Use the drop-down menu beside each option to choose which {{group}} data view (if any) you would like to use for that particular role.

### If You Have a Profile Header {{Group}} Data View (Above), Show Empty Fields?

   This gives you the option to hide fields in header rows when there is no information to show. For example, if your data view includes ‘age’, this field name will only show in the header bar for profiles where an age has been entered. Where there is no age in the profile the field name will not appear.

### {{Group}} Data View to Use on Relations Tab

   Choose one of your {{group}} data views from the drop-down list to decide what additional information will be displayed on table in the relationships tab in profiles. It’s fine not to use any data view, and the relationships table will look like this:

### Which Tab to Show Initially When Viewing Profiles

   Choose from the drop-down list which tab will be displayed first when you open a profile. Note that some tabs will not always be visible on all profiles (especially custom tabs). For example, you may have a ‘personal details’ tab which is present on your clients’ profiles, but not for staff.

### Profile Tab Order

   This allows you to  decide which profile tabs you want to see, and to re-order them. By default, tabs will initially be unticked and you will see them all. If you want to choose which to see, tick the ones which you would like to be visible. Any which remain unticked will then be hidden – you can always come back to personal settings to edit your choices. 
   
   A note of caution – if you have specified which tabs you would like to be able to see and then new tabs are added to your system, you will need to come back to this list to tick them or they will remain hidden.  
 
When you have ticked the tabs that you would like to see, you can left click then drag and drop them in the list to change the order. Note that some tabs will not always be visible in all profiles (especially custom fields – see above).         
                              
### Split Tabs in Profiles into Sections

   This option changes the way profile tabs are displayed. By default they will show in one row at the top of a profile (this row may extend over more than one line, depending on the width of your screen). If you choose this option, {{Lamplight}} will split them into categories in separate rows:

### How Would You Like {{Outcome}}s Displayed on Profiles?

   There are 3 different ways to view {{outcome}}s in the ‘{{Outcome}}s‘ profile tab.
   
#### The Radar Chart
This option gives you a chart which shows you all the {{outcome}}s recorded for a set of measures. You can also add new scores to the chart directly, or to a set of drop-down boxes. 
      
      ![The Radar Chart](16.4.2f.png)
      
#### Advanced Table
This table has a column for every month each individual {{outcome}} has been measured. You can add another score to a measure in the final column. 
      
      ![The Advanced Table](16.4.2g.png)
      
Click on any of the scores in the table to bring up a editing box where you can change details or delete them altogether.
      
      ![Editing in the Advanced Table](16.4.2h.png)
      
#### Normal Table
Each row of this table shows one time that a measure has been recorded. You can re-order the table by date, category, {{workarea}} or individual measure, depending on the information you are looking for.
