# 17.3.0    {{Outcome}}s {{report}}

> The {{outcome}}s {{report}} summarises the changes over time recorded in the {{outcome}}s tab. 

The {{outcome}}s {{report}} summarises the changes over time recorded in the {{outcome}}s tab. The options available in the {{report}} presentation tab are:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}} - presentation]({{imgpath}}132a.png)

There are different ways to summarise {{outcome}} data. By default, it works by looking at each {{person}}, and for each {{outcome}} calculating the difference between the latest and earliest {{outcome}}s recorded. It then calculates an average and other summary data for everyone. This means that only {{people}} with at least two {{outcome}}s recorded within the dates specified will be included in the {{report}}, so that the system can calculate a difference. 

You can also look just at 'yes-no' {{outcome}}s and count up the number of 'yes' responses. This will be useful if the {{outcome}} is something achieved, and you are interested in the number of times it has been achieved (for example, 'Invited to job interview'). 

The 'snapshot' option just looks at the values, not the change in them. This will give you a picture of 'where people are', but not what change has been achieved. 

The scores for Yes-no outcomes are treated as no = 0 and yes = 1.
