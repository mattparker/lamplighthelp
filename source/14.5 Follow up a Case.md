# 14.5 Follow up a {{Linked case}}

When adding {{activity}} records ({{work}}, {{referral}}, {{outcome}} etc.) to a {{linked case}} which already has a similar record, you can duplicate the existing one. This keeps details from the original (date and time, {{work}} area, attendees, notes etc.), so you can edit this rather than starting from scratch.

1. Go to the &#039;{{Linked case}} view&#039; tab in a profile

2. Click on the {{linked case}} in the {{group}} to the left that you need to add the record to

3. Scroll down to the table of records and find the one that you want to duplicate. Either right-click on the table row, or left click on the context menu in the first table column

4. From the pop-up menu, choose &#039;Follow up {{linked case}}&#039;. This will open a duplicate record

5. Edit the details as necessary, then click &#039;Save&#039; at the bottom. The record will be saved into the {{linked case}}

6. If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}} or the {{linked case}} is closed, you cannot follow it up and the option will be disabled (appearing as greyed-out text in the menu) â€“ need screenshot here.
