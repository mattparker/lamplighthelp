# 2.3 Adding Two factor authentication

**Please note – you will need to have an authentication app on your phone before you start.**

Two factor authentication adds a layer of protection to the login process. When set up, an app on your phone generates a 6-digit code every 30 seconds, which is only valid for 30 seconds. To log in you must enter your username/password followed by this 6-digit code. While it does add an extra step to the login process, the security benefits are significant.


**Adding 2FA to Your Account**

First install an app on your phone (see links to app store versions of the Authenticator app below), or simply search for 'Authenticator App' in your app store: 
  - Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB)
  - Windows Marketplace: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj?rtc=1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj?rtc=1)
  - Apple App Store: [https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)
