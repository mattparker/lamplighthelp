# 2.3 Adding Two factor authentication

> Enabling two factor authentication adds a layer of protection to the log-in process

Two factor authentication adds a layer of protection to the login process. When set up, an app on your phone generates a 6-digit code, which is only valid for 30 seconds. To log in you must enter your username and password followed by this 6-digit code. While it does add an extra step to the login process, the security benefits are significant.

### Adding 2FA to Your Account

First install an app on your phone (see links to app store versions of the Authenticator app below), or simply search for 'Authenticator App' in your app store:

Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB.
Windows Marketplace: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj?rtc=1.
Apple App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8.

Please note – you will need to have an authentication app on your phone before you start.

### Checking 2FA

If you are a System administrator you can see if two factor authentication is enabled for each operator in the Database operators table in System admin

To verify which operators have 2FA enabled:
- Go to 'system admin -> Database Operators and Security -> Manage database operators'.
- Check the 'Two factor authentication enabled' column in the database operators table. If it says "Yes," then Two Factor Authenitcation is turned on for that user.
