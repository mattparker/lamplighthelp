#  16.3.1 Adding Two Factor Authentication to Your Account

> Adding two factor authentication is done on an individual basis, so each person has to carry out these steps

To add two factor authentication to your account:

- First install an app on your phone (see links to app store versions of the Authenticator app below).
   - Google Play: ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB))
   - Windows Marketplace: ([https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj?rtc=1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj?rtc=1))
   - Apple App Store: ([https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8))

- Go into system admin and in the Manage database operators section, click on 'Enable two-factor authentication.'
- Lamplight will generate a secret code that you need to enter in the app on your phone, like this one (this is just a sample code):





- Youâ€™ll only need to enter this into your phone once. When this is done, your phone and Lamplight can both generate the 6-digit code you need to log in.
