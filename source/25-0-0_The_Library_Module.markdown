# 25.0.0 The Library Module

> The Library Module enables you to store documents and other media (pictures, video etc.) within {{Lamplight}}. These resources are not linked to particular profiles, and serve as a static resource that all database operators can access



The Library Module is used to store documents and can be used however necessary. It could be to save {{report}}s or to share information such as HR policies amongst members of {{staff}}. 

All resources are saved centrally and are not linked to a specific profile. It is possible to tag and catagorise items to make them easy to search for.
