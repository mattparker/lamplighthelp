# 7.1.2 {{Work}} Records: Adding Attendance Details

> The attendance tab stores who was at the {{work} session



The attendance tab records details of everyone who is involved with a particular session. As well as {{user}}s, this can include {{staff}}, {{volunteer}}s or other contacts. If you are entering details in advance, you can record people as booked. It can even include details of people who were expected to attend but did not for some reason. This means that you can look back and report on different people's involvement. 

The {{work}} record will appear in the {{work}} records tab of anyone included in the attendance table.

### Adding a {{Person}}, {{Org}} or Group to the Attendance Table
If you are creating the work record in a profile, the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile it is will already be listed in the attendance table as a {{user}}. You may also be there as {{staff}}, depending on your personal settings. (You can see how to add yourself to any {{work}} record you input in [16.4.3 Personal Settings - Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.4.3)).

To add additional {{people}}:
- Start typing their name in the search box at the top of the page. 
- When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches. 
- Click on the name you want to add them to the table. 
- If you can't see the name that you are looking for, keep typing until it appears. If it does not come up as a suggestion, you will need to check that they have a profile in the system. (It may be possible to add new profiles to your system from the attendance table - for more on this see [7.1.3 Adding New People to the Database from the {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.3)).

If you have already set up a {{group}} and you would like to add the members of it to the table in bulk, follow the instructions above, searching for the name of the {{group}}. When you choose the {{group}} name from the list, the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.

### Changing Attendance Roles
To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person:
- Click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear.

- Select the appropriate option. Your System Administrator can add options to these lists (see section [16.6.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0)).

A {{person}}'s role in a {{work}} record shows why they were there in this instance. For example, someone who both uses services and volunteers can attend in either capacity. 

### Adding Notes to the Attendance Table
There is also the option to add any further notes concerning the individual attendees. 
- Click in the notes box along from their name.
- Add any text you need into the box.
- Click save to exit.

### Removing a {{Person}} or {{Org}} from the Attendance Table
To remove someone added in error click the delete box which is in the final column of the table on the right. This will only remove them  from the table, not the database.

### Custom Columns
You may see more columns in your table. These will be ones that are unique to your organisation, customised for the work that you do. If you are unsure how to complete these, please ask your System Administrator.

### Updating All Rows
On some systems, there will be an option to 'Update all rows' for each column, underneath the last person in the attendance table.  Using this will update every {{person}} or {{organisation}} in the table with the option you choose.  So for example, if everyone in the record has an attendance type of 'Booked' by changing this to 'Attended' and pressing 'Update all rows', the attendance type will be changed to 'Attended' for everyone on the page. You can also add a note for everyone in the table in this way.

### Adding Unknown Attendees
The box below the attendance table is called 'Number of unknown {{people}} attending'. This lets you put in a number, but no details of  people that attended who are unknown to you. You might need this for a large public event, for example. If you use this feature, when you report they will be counted as a number of attendances, but not unique individuals because there is no way to check whether you would be double-counting the anonymous individuals in different sessions.
