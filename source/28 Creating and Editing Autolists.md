# 28 Creating and Editing Autolists

**Need links to other help pages for {{group}}s**

{{Group}}s in Lamplight are collections of profiles or {{org}}s. You can create different types of {{group}}: auto {{group}}s, manual {{group}}s or merge {{group}}s. You can use information from profiles or {{activity}} records to filter your {{group}} members.

1. To create a {{Group}} click on {{Group}}s and Click Add

2. Choose the type of {{Group}} you would like to create
- Auto {{group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. &#039;{{postcode}} starts with N1&#039;) and Lamplight searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}}, Lamplight will automatically check again. For example, if someone moves out of the area and you update their {{postcode}}, that {{person}} will not appear in the {{group}} when it is next run.
