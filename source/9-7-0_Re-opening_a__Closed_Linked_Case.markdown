# 9.7.0    Re-opening a Closed {{Linked Case}}

> Once you have closed a {{linked case}} you may need to re-open it, for example to link another record. 

To re-open a closed {{linked case}}, find a record that it linked to it, right click on this record to open the context menu, and choose 'Re-open {{linked case}}.'

If a record is not linked to any {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is already open, you cannot re-open it and the option will be disabled.
