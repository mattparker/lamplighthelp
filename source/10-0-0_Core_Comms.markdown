# 10.0.0  <i class="fas fa-envelope-open"></i>  Core {{Comm}}s

> You can create and send communications using the core functions in {{Lamplight}}, without the {{comm}}s module enabled.



A '{{comm}}' created within {{Lamplight}} is a letter, email or mailing labels. If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you may also be able to send SMS messages.

When you send emails from Lamplight they will be set up in the system and then sent through your email server, so restrictions on number of emails and size of attachments that apply to your organisation's emails will still apply when using Lamplight. 

Before you can send emails through Lamplight your system or project administrator will need to set up your server details in system administration (for more information see [16.11.0 Setting Up Email](/help/index/p/16.11.0)).

There are more advanced features available if you have the {{Comm}}s Module. These include:
- Saving {{comm}}s records.
- Having a {{comm}}s tab in profiles.
- Using {{comm}}s templates
- Linking to Mailchimp using {{Lamplight}} mailing lists. 
For more information on this see [21.0.0 The {{Comm}}s Module](/help/index/p/21.0.0).
