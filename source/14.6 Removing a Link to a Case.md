# 14.6 Removing a Link to a {{Linked case}}

Records can be removed from a {{linked case}}. The record is will not be deleted
It is possible to remove a record from a {{linked case}}. This removes the link, but does not delete the record. Once the link has been taken away, the record will appear back in the &#039;Unlinked records&#039; section of the &#039;{{Linked case}} view&#039; tab.
To remove the link:
Go to the &#039;{{Linked case}} view&#039; tab in the profile
Find the {{linked case}} that the record is currently linked to from the boxes on the left. Click on it to open
