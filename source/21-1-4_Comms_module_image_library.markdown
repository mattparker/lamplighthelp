# 21.1.4 The {{Comm}}s Module Image Library

> The image library stores images that you can use in your {{comm}}s and {{comm}} templates

Before you can add a file image to a {{comm}} you will need to upload it to the {{comm}}s image library. **Make sure that the item you're adding is the size that you will want it to be when you use it**. You won't be able to resize it within your {{Lamplight}} {{comm}}.

To add an image:

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> {{Comm}} Settings -> {{Comm}} image library'.
   - Current items in the library are displayed as thumbnails so that you can preview them all.

   - These are also the images that will appear on the drop-down 'Image library' menu in the text editor when creating {{comm}}s.
- Click the 'Add library item' button on the left. 
- A popup window will appear: 
   - Give the image a name to describe what it is  (for example, organisation logo)
   - Browse to where the image is stored on your computer and select it.  
   - Click the 'save' button to add it to the library.
- To remove an image from the library, click the small red 'x'.
