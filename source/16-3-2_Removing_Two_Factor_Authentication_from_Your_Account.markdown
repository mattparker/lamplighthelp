#  16.3.2 Removing Two Factor Authentication from Your Account

> If your phone is lost of stolen, you should ask your system administrator to reset two factor authentication for your login as soon as possible. 


- Go to system admin, then under Manage Database Operators choose Add, edit and remove operators.
- From the table of operators, find your name and click this or the menu button to the left of the row.
- Click on Remove two-factor authentication in the menu.

You can then set up two factor authentication again, which will generate a new shared secret.
