# 27.4.0 Media Module: Viewing Storage Usage

> The Media Module includes 5 GB of storage per {{project}}. You can keep track of how much has been used in system administration, and  purchase additional storage as necessary



### Storage Limits

Every piece of information you save in Lamplight will take up storage space. High resolution images or long films can be particularly large.

5GB of storage per {{project}} is included each month as part of the module cost, and additional storage can be purchased if required. Images and films you link to from other sites do not take up any storage space.

### Viewing Your Storage Use

To see how much of your data allowance you have used:
- Go to 'admin -> system administration', and then in the 'Module Administration' section at the bottom, find 'Media Module'. 
- Click 'View file storage and allowance'. 
- You will see the current usage for each of the projects you have access to.

- Total storage space is combined across {{project}}s, so if one goes over it automatically 'borrows' space from another {{project}} that has spare capacity.
