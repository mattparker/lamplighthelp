# 7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records

> It is possible to view all the {{work}} records in your system in one table 

You can view all of the {{work}} records in your system in a single table. However, if your organisation has a large number of records, it would be best to filter these down (see below) so that they do not take too long to retrieve. 

### Viewing the Table

- Click on '{{Work}}' on the main menu.
- Hover over 'view' on the sub-menu.
- Choose '{{work}}' from the drop-down list. 
- If you see a final sub-menu choose 'standard {{Work}} listing' to start a fresh view. There will be other options which are saved {{activity}} view templates. For more on this, see [7.3.1 Viewing All {{Activity}} Records Using an {{Activity}} View Template](/help/index/p/7.3.1).
- You will see the following screen:

- The table shows all {{work}} records occurring within a set date range ordered by date latest in the range showing at the top.  
- The default range of dates shown (for example, all records from two months in the past to two months in the future) can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual. For more on this see [16.4.3 Personal Settings: Default Values for Dates on Lists](/help/index/p/16.1.3). 

**Choose and Save which Table Columns You See**

- You can choose which columns you see in the table by right clicking in the coloured header row.  This will show you a list of all the possible columns. If a column is ticked it will be visible in the table, and unticked items are hidden.  
- You can change this by clicking on the column you wish to show or hide. 
- If you want to make that change the default view, right click again on the header row, and from the bottom of the pop-up list choose 'Save table columns layout'.  These will now be the columns that you see by default when you run this type of table. This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  
- Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the standard system view.  (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, see below, these can also be saved.)

### The Table Search Bar

Above the table is a bar marked 'Search'. If you click on this then you will find additional options you can use to filter your records, and some extra columns to add. 

**Filters**
The top section gives you filters that you can use to narrow down the selection of {{work}} records you see.

- Date and time. You can choose the date range that you want the records to cover.
- {{Workarea}}. You can restrict the records to specific {{workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s. 
- {{Staff}} member adding record. This drop-down box lists all {{staff}} on the system. If you only want to see records added by a specific person, choose their name from the list. 
- Location. Use this to restrict your search to sessions which have happened in a particular place. 
- Show deleted records. If you want to see deleted records in your search, tick this box. No current records will be included in the results. 

**Additional Data Columns to Display**
The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  
- This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  
- Clicking here will give you options to display names of different {{people}} or {{org}}s who are listed in the records' attendance tables, as well as other items from the custom fields in your {{work}} records.

**Custom Field Filters**
The final search bar is called 'Custom field filters'. Click on the bar to open it. 

- This lets you select additional filtering options to narrow down your selection, using details of who attended the {{work}} record and custom fields unique to your organisation.  

#### After applying additional filters, click the 'Fetch data' button to show the matching records.


### Downloading and Printing the Table

**Downloading to a Spreadsheet**
- Just above the table, make sure that the 'Show' drop-down is set to 'all'. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the table and click the 'Download' button.  
- Depending on your browser, your table may immediately open in a spreadsheet, or you may need to click on a 'Download' box at the bottom of the screen to open it.

**Opening Print View**
- Clicking the Print button at the bottom of the table will open the table in a new tab in a print-friendly format.  
- Split print allows you to create multiple print-friendly tables split by whatever item you choose, for example work area. Each one will open in a separate tab.
