# 7.3.0    Viewing All {{Work}} Records

> To view all {{work}} records, click '{{Work}} -> view' on the main menu. 

To view a list of all {{work}} records, click on '{{Work}}' on the main menu, hover over 'view' on the sub-menu and click '{{work}}' on the drop-down list. You will see the following screen:

![{{Work}} records list](59a.png)

This lists all {{work}} records occurring within a set date range, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.  The default range of dates shown, can be set in your 'Personal Settings', and can be different for each individual.  We recommend speaking to your system administrator before making changes.

**Restrict by date and work area**

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the search bar or the '+' icon on the right of the search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.

**Restrict by custom fields**

Once you have clicked the search bar as above, and the date and work area options are displayed, you will see a further two search bars shown below this.  The first called 'Custom field filters'.  This lets you select additional filtering options, from the fields inside your  {{work}} record.  Click the 'Fetch data' button to show records matching these filters.

**Display additional columns**

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Clicking on here will allow you to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your work records.

**Choose and save which table columns you see**

You can adjust the columns shown in the table by right clicking in the headings row of the table.  This will show you a list of all the columns that it is possible to show. If a column is ticked it will show in the table, and unticked rows are hidden.  You can change this by clicking on the column you wish to show or hide. 

If you wish to make that change the default view, right click again on the header row, and from the bottom of the pop-up list choose 'Save table columns layout'.  These will now be the columns that you see by default when you run this type of table. This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the standard system view.  (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, these can also be saved.)

**Downloading and printing the table**

If you wish to download the information you have searched for into a spreadsheet, click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table'.  Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose.
