# 33.1.0 Raising a {{Safeguarding case}}

> Any system operator may raise a {{safeguarding case}}. Go to main menu {{activity}} > {{safeguarding}} > raise {{safeguarding case}}

Any operator may raise a {{safeguarding case}} about someone. When they do, {{safeguarding}} managers will be notified by email, and will take
forward the {{safeguarding case}}. To raise a {{safeguarding case}} go to {{activity}} > {{safeguarding}} > raise a {{safeguarding case}}.

The information entered here will only be visible to {{Safeguarding}} Managers and whoever is assigned as {{safeguarding lead contact}} to it.
When raising your {{safeguarding case}}, you will need to provide a one sentence summary of your concern. Full details of your {{safeguarding case}}
should be entered into the description box. This can also include images which can be pasted into the text.

You will need to say who the {{safeguarding case}} is about: start typing their name and a drop down list will be shown. Select the
correct person. If other people are involved in any way, they can be added below that to the table. Add people to this
as normal, by typing their name in the search box and selecting it from the search results.

There may be further fields which you can complete if necessary.

The information entered here cannot be edited once entered, although you and others can add to it. When you save your
{{safeguarding case}} the {{safeguarding}} managers in your organisation will automatically receive an email notifying them of the
{{safeguarding case}}.
