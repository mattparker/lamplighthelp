# 17.2.0 Simple {{Project}} Sharing

> With simple {{project}} sharing you can choose which profiles you want to share across the {{project}}s in your system

Once you have your new {{project}}, if you are using simple {{project}} sharing then you are ready to go.

In each individual profile you will now see a '{{Project}} sharing' tab. If you can't see this, you may need to go into your personal settings to select it. For more on this see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2).

When you click on the '{{Project}} sharing' tab you will see a list of the {{project}}s in your system, and which ones this {{person}} or {{org}} is currently shared with.

To change the {{project}}s this profile is shared with, click on the 'edit' button to the right of the screen. This will open a screen where you can tick and untick checkboxes as necessary.
