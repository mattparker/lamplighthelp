2.1.0 Common Terms

> A guide to some of the more common terms used in {{Lamplight}}


{{Lamplight}} is an intuitive system and much of the terminology will be familiar to you. However, there are some key terms which will help you to find your way around.


**{{User}}**   

   – These are the {{people}} you work with who benefit from your service. For more on {{people}} see section [5.1.0 Profiles](/index/help/p/5.1.0)

**{{Workarea}}** 

   – Often these will be based on your workstreams – the services you provide or types of activity you carry out. For example, Mentoring, Ballet or Schools Outreach. They will probably already have been set up in your system, but the System Admnistrator can always add more or edit the ones that you have. To find out how to do this, see section [16.6.1 System Administration: Adding and editing {{workarea}}s](/help/index/p/16.6.1).

**{{Subworkarea}}** 

   – You can use these to further divide up the work you do. They help you to record a finer level of detail and monitor who is attending what. For example, Mentoring can be further divided into Education and Employment. As with {{workareas}}, these will probably already be set up in your system, although the System Administrator can add and edit them. For more on this see the section on adding {{workareas}} above. 

**{{Outcome}}s** 

   – This is the change or difference you have made to your {{user}}s. This is measured over time and more than once to show  before and after scores for comparison. To understand more about {{outcome}}s, please see section [8.0.0 Outcomes](/help/index/p/8.0.0).

**{{Group}}** 

   – {{Group}}s are used to make sets of {{people}} or {{org}}s that you have brought together for some reason: to communicate with, to report on, or to work with. You can create as many groups as you need and use them in various ways. For more on setting up {{group}}s, please see section [11 Groups](/help/index/p/11.0.0). 

**Tab** 

   – Most pages in Lamplight are organised into tabs to keep everything tidy. Tabs are like folder dividers in a ring binder. To view the content of a tab click on its title.

**Field** 

   - This is where you add information to the system. Fields can be text areas, select boxes, date boxes, tick boxes etc.

**Search Bar** 

   – The search bar is where you can find people organisations, work, outcomes - whatever you need to find.
There is always one in the top right of the screen. See [3.2.0 The Search Bar](/help/index/p/3.2.0) for more information. 

**Help**  

   - This help manual can be found at any time by clicking on the ‘Help’ button to the right of the search box. This contains detailed information on Lamplight’s set-up and how to carry out the processes that you need.

**Table**
