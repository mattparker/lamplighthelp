> You can use the geocode option to add geographic information to the addresses in your system



If you do not have geographic information attached to the contact details in your system you can geocode the addresses to provide ward, borough and longitude and latitude data. Lamplight will use the postcode on addresses and match it to Ordnance Survey data. This is not always as accurate as post office data but is free for users. Postcodes which are not geocoded will be listed.

To do this:
- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Data Management -> Geocode addresses'.
- You will get a confirmation once geocoding is complete showing you then number of addresses which have been geocoded and those postcodes for which no information was found.
