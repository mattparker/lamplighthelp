# 11.1.0 Creating an {{Auto Group}}

> An auto {{group}} allows you to choose criteria which {{Lamplight}} then uses to match profiles to the {{group}}. They can be set up either for {{people}} or {{org}}s


With {{group}}s in {{Lamplight}}, less is often more. It is important to know what it is that you are looking for before you start, and not to add too many filters to your {{group}} as you could exclude all possible members in this way. Once you have finished choosing filters, your {{group}} will include {{people}} or {{org}}s that meet **ALL** the criteria you have entered. 

To set up a new {{group}}:

- On the main menu go to '{{group}}s -> add -> add {{auto group}}'. 
- You will see the following screen:

![Creating an {{auto group}}](103a.png)

**The only two tabs that you have to fill out are the 'Group name' and '{{People}} and {{org}}s ones. You should pick the filters you need carefully from the other tabs.**


### {{Group}} Name

The {{group}} name and a description are compulsory - you can't save your choices without filling these in.  
 - Choose something that makes it clear who your {{group}} is made up of as these fields are used to remind you and other users of what the {{group}} is for - you will not be the only person using it. 
- If you use this group for a specific purpose, such as quarterly reporting of for a particular funder, you can make a note of this in the '{{Group}} description' field to make it easier to find the next time you need it, and also flag what it is for to other database operators. 
- There is a 'Lock {{group}}' option here.  If you tick this box then only you will be able to edit the {{group}}. If it is important that you know the criteria stay the same, for example when creating a {{group}} for regular reporting, then we would recommend you choose this option. 


### {{People}} or {{Org}}s
 
![Auto {{Group}}s - Choosing What Types of {{People}} to Add](103b.png)

- You must choose whether your auto {{group}} will include {{people}}, {{org}}s or {{families}} - you cannot have a mixture. If you need more than one of these types, you can create a {{group}} for each and them merge them (see [11.3.0 Creating a Merge {{Group}}](/help/index/p/11.3.0) for more details). 
- Unlike most fields in auto {{groups}}, the 'who are' choice (e.g. {{user}}, {{staff}},{{contact}} etc.) is an 'OR' search, so it will include those that meet **any** of the criteria selected, not those that meet all of them. 
- Next is the option to select the date profiles were added to the system.
  - On or after. 
  - On or before.
  - On.
  - Between. If you choose this option, a second date box will appear so that you can specify two dates. 
- The 'Visibility' drop-down box allows you to choose whether your {{group}} will be made up of people who are active on your system, or those who have been archived. For more on archiving, see [16.8.2 Archiving Profiles](/help/index/p/16.8.2). You cannot mix current and archived profiles in the same auto {{group}}.
