# 29.3.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Add, Edit and Delete {{Staff}} Activity Information

> With the {{Staff}} Management Module you can add training, absence, appraisal and non-contact records to {{staff}} profiles

Each member of {{staff}} will have tabs in their profile where you can add training, absence, appraisal and non-contact records. These will only be visible to the {{staff}} member themselves and people who are in their direct line of management.

If you have the {{Staff}} Management Module but can't see these tabs in a profile:
- Go to your own profile. If you can see them there it means you do not have permission to see them in the {{staff}} profile you were viewing. Your System Administrator may need to amend the {{staff}} hierarchy to enable you to view them. For more on this see [29.1.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Set-up in System Admin](/help/index/p/29.1.0).
- If you can't see the tabs in your own profile you need to make them visible in your personal settings. For more on this see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2). Once you have made changes, press F5 on your keyboard to refresh the system. 

### Creating a New Record

This follows a similar process to adding {{work}} records (see section [7.1.0  Adding a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.0)).

- Go to the {{staff}} member's profile and click on the tab you wish to enter information into. 
- On the right-hand side of the screen click 'add'. 
- A new form will open. The record is split into tabs: 'When and where', 'Attendance' and 'Details'. These must be completed before saving. 
- {{Staff}} non-contact records can also be added and viewed from the diary. Please see section [7.1.6 Creating {{Work}} Records from the Diary](/help/index/p/7.1.6) for more information. 

 ### Editing and Deleting Records
 
- Find the record in the relevant tab. Existing records will appear in a table.

- Right-click on the one you would like to edit, or left-click on the menu button to the left of it.
- From this menu, you can choose to 'View full details', 'Edit' or 'Delete'.
