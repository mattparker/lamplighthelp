# 32.3.1 Types of Map: Constant value Map

> A Constant Value map simply replaces data in a column with the same value in every row.  It's the simplest type of map and can be used to blank out data, or create a column with a reference ID for your organisation.

All fields can be use a Constant Value Map.  To set a column to be a Constant Value Map, select the field from the dropdown
and click the 'constant value map' button.

You can then alter the column header, and set the value that you wish to see in the column. Leave this blank if you want
an empty column.

A Constant Value Map can be used when you need a column for an organisation reference - i.e. for your organisation - 
that is always the same for all rows.
