# 30.0.0 {{Waiting List}}s Module

> An overview - The {{Waiting List}} module enables you to create {{waiting list}}s, manage them and run {{report}}s. 

A {{waiting list}} is a list of {{people}} or {{org}}s: {{Lamplight}} records when they are added and removed from the {{waiting list}}, making it easy for you to keep track of, and report on, waiting times. 

Unlike other modules in Lamplight, there is not a requirement for system administrators to make any ‘back-end’ changes.

To access and use {{waiting list}}s you will need to have the access level of Staff, Manager, System Administrator or Project Admin.
