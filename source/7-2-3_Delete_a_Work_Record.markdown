# 7.2.3   <i class="fas fa-hammer"></i>   Delete a {{Work}} Record

> It is possible for operators who have Manager or Administrator levels of access to delete {{activity}} records. This should be done with caution, as there is no way to undelete them



To delete a record:
- Find the record in the table (for more on this see [7.2.0 Viewing {{Work}} Records for an Individual](/help/index/p/7.2.0)).
- Click on the context menu button to the left of it, or right-click on the relevant row.
- From the pop-up context menu choose 'delete'.

- You will be asked to confirm deletion. Make sure that you have the correct record, as it is not possible to undelete.

- If it is a recurring record, you will be given the option to delete all the records in the series. This would erase every record that was still part on the recurring sequence. For more on this, see [7.1.5 Recurring Records](/help/index/p/7.1.5).
