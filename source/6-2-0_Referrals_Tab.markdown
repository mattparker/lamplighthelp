The order in which the records are displayed can be changed by clicking on the column headings. The default setting for viewing {{referral}} records is 5 to a page, but this can be changed by your system administrator via the global settings option in the system administration menu. Alternatively you can use the page numbers to move through the records. 

To add a new {{referral}} click on the 'Add' button on the right hand side of the screen. For more on creating new {{referral}} records see section [10.1.0  Adding a {{referral}} record](/help/index/p/10.1.0)
