1. To start a new {{report}} Click on {{Report}}s, you will see all the {{activity}} {{report}}s that are available within your system. Choose the section/type of report you want, and select the options to start a new report 'using your own criteria'.

![36 {{Report}} Filters - step 1](36_Report_Filters_im_1.png)

2. When you start a new {{report}} first you will see the date range, which you can edit for your requirements. The &#039;after this date&#039; and &#039;before or on this date&#039; fields will include records dated between these two dates, including the dates selected.

3. The first drop down is {{Report}} filters, click on this
All {{report}}s have the same initial set of filters, shown below:

![36 {{Report}} Filters - step 3](36_Report_Filters_im_3.png)

4. {{Work}} area

The '{{Workarea}}' options allow you to filter for particular {{workarea}}s, or {{subworkarea}}s. You can choose to report on as many of these as you need. If you leave all the options blank, then {{Lamplight}} will report on all of your {{workarea}}s. In the same way if you select a work area and leave all the {subworkarea}}s blank, it will report on all of those {{subworkareas}}. As soon as you select one, it will narrow down to just that one.

5. Location

You can choose one of more locations from this {{group}} to filter your {{report}} by.

6. {{Group}}

If you have already set up a {{group}}, you can choose it from the drop-down list so that the initial set of {{people}} or {{org}}s you are reporting on is restricted to members of the {{group}} (for more on {{group}}s, see [12 {{Group}}s](/help/index/p/12)).

The {{report}} will show data only for the members of the {{group}}, but does not apply the filters for the {{group}} to the {{report}}. 

For example, you may create a {{group}} of everyone attending any {{work}} session in April 2025 called 'April 2025 Clients'. You can then use it as a filter to see how much {{work}} you have done with these same people in June 2025. To do this, you would need to select 'date from' in your {{report}} as 1st June 2025; 'date to' as 30th June; and in the {{group}} drop-down select 'April 2025 Clients'. {{Lamplight}} will show data for the number of attendances in June.

7. Attendance Type

The 'Attendance type' option allows you to filter your {{report}} so that it only includes data on those who attended, excluding those who did not attend or cancelled, for example. This will depend on the way your organisation has chosen to use the 'Attendance type' column in your {{work}}, {{referral}} and other records. [See more here](/help/index/p/7.1.2).

10. Role

This filter looks at what capacity the person attended an activity in. For example, you can show data for just {{user}}s or {{staff}} who attended the sessions.  See [section 7.1.2](/help/index/p/7.1.2) for more about this when creating {{activity}} records.

9. Profile Type

If your system has, for example, {{users}}s who could be a Person {{user}}, {{Org}} {{user}} or Family {{user}}, then selecting this is essential to chose whether you are reporting on {{people}}, {{org}} or family. This may not be necessary in your system, and Lamplight can support you if it's important for you to understand this. If in doubt, choose the type of profile role you are reporting on.

![36 {{Report}} Filters - step 9](36_Report_Filters_im_9.png)

10. Include Archived Profiles

This option is ticked by default, so relevant data for profiles which have been archived will be included in the {{report}}. It will not unarchive the profile.

For example, if you have a {{user}} who attended in April 2025, but did not come to another session for 6 months, you may decide to archive his profile as he is no longer active. However, when you run your reports for 2025, the work that you did with him would still be included in the numbers.
