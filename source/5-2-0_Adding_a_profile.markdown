# 5.2.0 <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Adding a Profile

> To add a new profile for a {{person}} or {{org}}, click '{{people}} -> add new' on the main menu



To add a new profile, go to the top menu bar, click on '{{People}}' and select 'Add' from the sub menu that appears.

![Add new {{person}} on the main menu](45a.png)

At this point you will see one of two things. 

- A drop-down menu asking you to choose the type of {{person}} you wish to create - (see [5.1.0 Profiles](/help/index/p/5.1.0) for more information about these roles.)

- Or the page where you will add details of the {{person}} or {{org}}. You'll be able to choose the type of {{person}} at the top of this page, and their role at the bottom, as shown below.

Whichever of these you see, the details page will be where you add the basic information about that individual or organisation.


- All profiles, whether they are for {{user}}s, {{staff}}, {{funder}}s, {{org}}s or {{contact}}s start from the same initial input page. However, they must be either a {{person}} or an {{org}} (you may also have '{{family}}' as an option): select which using the 'Type' options.

- If you are entering a {{person}} you will see input boxes for title, first name, surname and suffix. (Titles and suffixes will be available if your System Administrator has added them in the 'system administration' section). If you are entering an {{org}} you will see an input box for the {{org}} name.

- There may be some more information that you have to provide. This depends on whether your organisation has chosen to make it a requirement to include certain information in a profile (for example, an individual's permission to store their data.)

- If you have multiple projects in your system, you may also be asked to choose a project-sharing policy. Ask your Project Administrator about this if you’re uncertain. If you need to continue at this point, click ‘no sharing’, which can be updated later. 

- Save the profile by clicking the save button at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

You will now see the profile page for the {{person}} you have just entered. (If you get a pop-up box which tells you that you may be about to create duplicates, see the next page [5.2.1 Creating Duplicate Profiles](/help/index/p/5.2.1).)

Along from their name is a series of buttons; 'Print', 'Restrict Processing', 'Archive' and 'Edit name'.

- Print: will open a new tab in your web browser with their profile information for you to choose which tabs of information you wish to print.
- Restricted processing: When a {{person}} requests that you restrict the processing of their data (under the [GDPR](/help/index/p/tagged_GDPR), you can add restricted processing to a profile so that you can't edit it, and it will not be included in any reporting.
- Archive: will remove the profile from the active system and archive it so that it will not appear in day to day use. It can still be retrieved if needed and can also be included in reports. For more on this see [16.8.2 Archiving Profiles](/help/index/p/16.8.2).
- Edit name: will open a form so that you can edit the name and type of profile. 

If you would like to see how this is done, we have a video, ['Creating a Profile'](/help/index/p/51.2.1).
