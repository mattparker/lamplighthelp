#    13.5.0 {{Referral}} {{Report}}s

>{{Referral}}{{report}}s allow you to count and summarise {{referral}}s within specific timeframes


{{Referral}} {{report}}s collate information captured within {{referral}} records, and information collected about those involved in the {{referral}}s can be used to add additional {{report}} presentation options. 

To run a {{referral}} {{report}}, on the main menu click on {{report}}s -> more -> {{referral}} {{report}} 

![{{Referral}} {{report}} results](185a.png)

The {{referral}} success and direction can be used as filters for this {{report}}. The options within them may vary as your system administrator is able to customise the lists to reflect how you need to capture your {{referral}} data.

The display format enables you to change the way in which your data is presented: you may select as many of these as needed. 

The row data and column data select boxes enable you to segment your data by the characteristics of those attending. The options in the drop-down boxes are the select-box fields in user profiles (see section [8.7.0  Other information tabs](/help/index/p/8.7.0) ). Note that if you select something in the 'Column data' drop-down you will not get a pie chart. 

The 'Data to show' options allow you to count your data in different ways.
