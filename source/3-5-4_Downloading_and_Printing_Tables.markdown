> Tables can be downloaded into spreadsheet packages with a single click



At the bottom of any table, you will find three options - Download, Print and split print.

### Downloading

To download a table into spreadsheet packages compatible with OpenOffice or Excel, click the 'Download' link at the bottom of the table. 

Depending on the browser that you are using, the new spreadsheet will either open on the screen, or a notification will appear. It could be in a tab at the bottom of your browser window.

You will be prompted to open or save the file (again, this can vary based on your browser and settings). 

### Printing

At the foot of each table, there is also the option to 'Print table'. Once selected a new print-friendly version of the table will open in a new tab on your browser.

To print, use your keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+P on a windows machine, Cmd+P on a Mac).

### Split Print

The final option is to 'split print'. This allows you to create multiple print-friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose. So for example, if you split by {{workarea}} (as in the image below), you will get a separate table for each different {{workarea}} in your table. These will each open in a separate tab.
