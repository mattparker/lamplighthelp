You can also save the columns that you have chosen so that each time you come back to this table it will automatically show the same layout. To do this, right click on the coloured header row, and at the bottom of the menu choose 'Save table columns layout'.

The layout is saved for this particular table (e.g. in the Relationships tab. Each different table in profiles and the main menu (e.g. {{work}} record tables), can have its own layout.

Select 'Reset table columns layout' on the header bar menu to restore the original {{Lamplight}} settings for the table you are working on. This will not affect settings for any other tables.
