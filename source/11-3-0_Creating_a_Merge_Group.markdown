# 11.3.0    Creating a Merge {{Group}}

> A merge {{group}} is a {{group}} which is created by combining the members of existing {{group}}s together

Merge {{group}}s change as their component {{group}}s change. Whenever you run a merge {{group}} it will check each of the {{group}}s that it is composed of and give an up-to-date list.

They also remove any duplicates, so if one {{person}} or organisation is present in more than one of the consitituent {{group}}s they will only appear once in the merge {{group}}. 

They can be used in the same way that manual {{group}} and auto {{group}}s are.

### To Create a Merge {{Group}}

- On the main menu go to '{{Group}}s -> add -> add merge {{group}}s'. 
- You will need to give the {{group}} a name and description.

- On the '{{Group}}s' tab start typing the name of the first {{group}} that you want to include in your merge {{group}}.
- When you find it, click to add it to the table. 
- Continue to find the {{group}}s you want to include until all have been added.
- Click 'Save'.
