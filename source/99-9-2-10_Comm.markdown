# 9.2.10    {{Comm}}

> To create a mail-merged letter or email for everyone attending a {{work}} record, click '{{comm}}' on the context menu. 

To communicate with the attendees of a {{work}} record, click '{{comm}}' on the context menu. This will open a popup window allowing you to create a {{comm}} (see section [12.1.0  Creating a {{comm}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.1.0)) with the attendance details already filled in. 

It will also allow you to use the details on the {{work}} records as merge fields. 

Click on the 'message content' tab and within the text editing toolbar a 'happen merge' (i.e. merge information about what happened) drop-down option is available. Select the fields you wish to be inserted into your {{comm}}. This will take the details entered from the {{work}} record.
