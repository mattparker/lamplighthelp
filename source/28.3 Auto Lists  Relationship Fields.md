# 28.3 Auto {{Group}}s: Relationship Fields

On this tab you can choose to filter by the relationships that are recorded in the profile. You can create auto {{group}}s of, for example, all the profiles who have a relationship of &#039;key {{work}}er&#039;, &#039;GP&#039; or &#039;trustee&#039; (if these are relationships that you use in your system). You will probably have different options to choose from.
1. Click on the Relationships tab

4. If you want to specify the dates between which the relationship was open, click in the ‘where relationship was current in this data range’ box.
There is the option here to use &#039;dynamic dates&#039; - for instance, you could select between start of the previous month and today. This means if you run this {{group}} on the 2nd February the {{group}} will search between 1st January to 2nd February.

6. If you use default contacts in your system, click in the ‘Show only profiles that are the default contact’ box to only include them

9. The option &#039;Include related profiles as the second profile for each {{group}} member&#039; controls whether the related profiles should appear in a second column of your table when viewing and using the {{group}}. This does not affect the search filters.

10. You can also use relationships to only show profiles that are related to members of another auto {{group}}.
For example in our test system we can select the {{group}} &#039;{{user}}s who identify as female&#039;

12. If we then select the &#039;partner&#039; option in the ‘With relationship’ box, our {{group}} will be filtered to only show {{people}} who are the partners of {{people}} who appear in the ‘{{User}}s who identify as female’ {{group}}
