# 32.2.0 Which fields can be used in CodeSets?

> Fields which can be used in CodeSets are built-in profile fields, custom profile fields, built-in {{activity}} fields, custom {{activity}} fields, attendance table fields, and {{linked case}} fields.

The main fields that are used in data views and {{activity}} views can be included in CodeSets.  All available fields
are listed in the 'Field to create Map for' drop-down when editing a CodeSet:



In the drop-down you will see fields grouped into sections:

 - Profile built-in name and contact details fields
 - Profile custom tabs and fields
 - {{Activity}} built-in fields - dates, workarea etc.
 - Custom {{activity}} tabs and fields
 - Attendance table fields including custom fields
 - {{Linked case}} fields

Depending on your system this list may be quite long.  Custom tab IDs are shown to help you identify the correct sections. 

There are different types of Map available depending on the type of field that you select.  For example, a date of birth
field allows you to reformat dates - but this isn't an option for 'profile name' field as it wouldn't make sense.

The different types of Map available are listed in the next section, and then details are given for each one.
