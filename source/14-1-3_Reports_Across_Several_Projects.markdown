# 14.1.3 {{Report}}s Across Several {{Project}}s

> The '{{Project}}s' tab lets you run a single {{report}} across several different {{project}}s, combining the results



If you have access to more than one {{project}} (for more on {{Lamplight}} {{project}}s see section [17  {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/17)) you will also see a '{{Project}}s' tab:

Simply tick the boxes for the {{project}}s you want to include, and {{Lamplight}} will combine the results from these into a single {{report}}.

Note that if you used {{group}} or {{workarea}} filters in the previous tab (see section [14.1.1  {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)) you need to be sure that these {{group}}s or {{workarea}}s are shared across all {{project}}s.
