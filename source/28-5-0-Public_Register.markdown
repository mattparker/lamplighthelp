# 28.5.0 Public sign-in

> The publishing module includes a sign-in module that allows you to register attendance at published {{work}} records using membership cards with QR codes on them.

### Overview

The public sign-in feature lets your users sign in and out of your events using a specially prepared QR code. You can
set up a publicly accessible computer (or tablet or phone) showing a special registration page, and the camera on that
device is used to scan their QR code. When they leave, they sign out again in the same way. New clients can register
through the sign-in page too. This is all logged straight onto your {{work}} records so that you know who's attended
what, and a [home page tab](/help/index/p/28/5.5) shows you who has signed in and out that day.

#### Publishing module settings

First you'll need to make sure you [have the publishing module](/help/index/p/16.20), and that the settings are correct.
Please refer to [section 28.2](/help/index/p/28.2) about the system admin settings and make sure {{work}} records can be
published, and enable the addition of attendees to {{work}] records. You will also need to enable 'create new profiles'
so that new members can join from the sign-in page.

#### Setting up computers to use as public registers

Because the registration page is publicly accessible without signing in to Lamplight, you need to register the devices
you intend to use first. You only need to do this once per device. See [section 28.5.1](/help/index/p/28.5.1) for
instructions on how to do this.

#### Create a {{work}} record to use with the public register

You'll need to create the {{work}} record in {{Lamplight}} first - see [section 28.5.2](/help/index/p/28.5.2) to make
sure you get the settings correct for this to work.

#### Generating QR codes

Users can sign in and out using a QR code that you'll need to provide them with.  [Section 28.5.3](/help/index/p/28.5.3)
explains how to generate these codes in Lamplight.

#### Using the public sign-in page

You need to visit a particular URL on a registered device to see the register.  [Section 28.5.4](/help/index/p/28.5.4)
gives instructions on how to do this, and how to use the public sign-in page.
