# 16.9.0 Creating {{Report}} Templates

> A {{report}} template is a way of saving the filters and display options for a particular {{report}} so that you can run it without having to re-enter them



{{Report}} templates are useful, for example, for regular management or funder {{report}}s, so that you don't need to create a new one each time. Although they are set up in system administration, the form is very similar to that of the one-off reports. Once they have been saved they can be chosen by any database operator from the main report menu.

You'll need to be a System Administrator to create templates.


### To Create a {{Report}} Template
- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Templates -> Manage report templates'.

- Once on this page, you will see options to add {{report}} templates for {{work}}, {{referral}}s, {{linked case}}s, {{outcome}}s, and any of the modules you have enabled.  You'll also be able to edit existing templates.

### Completing the Template
- We recommend test your planned {{report}} as a one-off from the main menu first to ensure it is has the filters that you want and is showing appropriate data. You can then  recreate it in the {{report}} templates section. This is because when you complete the template it will save without showing you the {{report}} results. For more on running a {{report}}, see [13.1.0 Running {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/13.1.0).

- The first page of the template is where you give the {{report}} a name, and a description, so that staff will know what it is designed to do.  We encourage you to be as specific as possible.

- The name of the report will appear in the main menu list, and the description will show if you hover over it.

- You can also lock the report so that only you can edit it on this page. 

- The next page is '{{Report}} filters'. This is very similar to the page you will see when creating a one-off {{report}}.

- The way that dates are created in a {{report}} template is different, offering more than just fixed dates. You can choose for example to run the {{report}} from the beginning of the previous quarter, to the end of the previous quarter.  This will ensure that whenever you run the report, it will be reporting in the previous quarter.

- You will see some other dynamic options too, including 'years' and 'months ago'. Whichever of these you choose, {{Lamplight}} will relate this to the date on which you run the report. So if you chose 'Today' as your 'Date to', for example, this {{report}} will always give results up to the day on which you are running it.
- The additional filters and presentation work as they would for one-off reporting.
- Once you have set up the filters and presentation, save your {{report}} using the 'save' button at the end of any page.
- When you use your template to run a {{report}}, you can scroll past all the filters to see the results table at the bottom of the page. However, as all the filters still appear you can also tweak the {{report}}, for example to change the dates slightly, or to show the results in a different way. This will only update the current {{report}} - the template can only be edited through system administration.

### Viewing {{report}} Templates
{{Report}} templates show on the main menu in a drop-down menu under the {{report}} type.

You will need to refresh the page in your browser, using the F5 key, in order to see newly added reports.
