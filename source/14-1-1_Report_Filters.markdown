# 14.1.1 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i>  {{Report}} Filters

> All {{report}}s let you filter by date, {{workarea}} and {{group}}. Other filters are available depending on the {{report}}



When you start a new report, it will open by default on the 'Report filters' tab.

All {{report}}s have the same set of filters initially, shown below:

![{{Report}} filters](13.1.1a.png)


#### Dates From and To
The 'Date from' and 'Date to' fields will include records dated between these two dates, including the dates selected.

#### {{Workarea}}
The '{{Workarea}}' options allow you to filter for particular {{workarea}}s, or {{subworkarea}}s. You can choose to report on as many of these as you need. If you do not tick any of the options, then {{Lamplight}} will report on all of your {{workarea}}s.

#### Location
You can choose one of more locations from this list to filter your report by.  

#### {{Group}}
If you have already set up a {{group}}, you can choose it from the drop-down list so that the initial set of {{people}} or {{org}}s you are reporting on is restricted to members of the {{group}} (for more on {{group}}s, see section [12  {{Group}}s](/help/index/p/12)). 

The {{report}} will show data for the members of the {{group}}, but does not apply the filters for the {{group}} to the {{report}}.

For example, you may create a {{group}} of everyone attending any {{work}} session in April 2019 called 'April 2019 Clients'. You can then use it as a filter to see how much {{work}} you have done with these same people in June 2019. To do this, you would need to select 'date from' in your {{report}} as 1st June 2019; 'date to' as 30th June; and in the {{group}} drop-down select 'April 2019 Clients'. {{Lamplight}} will show data for the number of attendances in June.

#### Attendance Type
The 'Attendance type' option allows you to filter your {{report}} so that it only includes data on those who attended, excluding those who did not attend or cancelled, for example. This will depend on the way your organisation has chosen to use the ['Attendance type' column in your {{work}}, {{referral}} and other records](/help/index/p/7.1.2).

#### Role
This filter looks at what capacity the person attended an activity in. For example, you can show data for just {{user}}s or {{staff}} who attended the sessions.  See [section 7.1.2](/help/index/p/7.1.2) for more about this when creating {{activity}} records.

#### Profile Type
You can use this filter to narrow your results down to {{person}}, {{organisation}} or {{family}} profiles (if they have been enabled by your system administrator). You can only choose one of these options at a time. If you do not choose any, then data for all these profile types will be included.

#### Include Archived Profiles

This option is ticked by default, so relevant data for profiles which have been archived will be included in the {{report}}. It will not unarchive the profile.

For example, if you have a {{user}} who attended in April 2019, but did not come to another session for 6 months, you may decide to archive his profile as he is no longer active. However, when you run your reports for 2019, the work that you did with him would still be included in the numbers.
