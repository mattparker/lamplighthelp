The table here shows you a list of all the campaigns open during the dates you have specified in personal settings, and some basic information, including the number of invitees and the number of respondents.  

You can use the 'Search' bar durectly above the table to filter the records you see by date, work area, custom fields, and to add additional columns.  See the 'filter' section below.

Using the context menu (small square on the left of each row), you also have a number of options.

* View Full details: Shows a summary of the campaign information and settings.
* Edit: Edits the campaign information and settings.
* Delete: Deletes the campaign.  You cannot undo this.
* Duplicate record: Duplicates the campaign, so that you can alter it, rather then creating afresh.
* Email all invitees/have responded/not yet reponded: Takes you to a communication page to email these invitees. [(Sending a communication)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.51.0)
* View report of reponses:  This takes you to an Evaluations report. [(Evaluation reporting 17.5.0)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.51.0)

__Filtering your view__

__Restrict by date and work area__

To restrict the listing to campaigns open within particular dates, or by {{workarea}}, click the search bar or the '+' icon on the right of the search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will update showing the requested information.

__Restrict by custom fields__

Once you have clicked the search bar as above, and the date and work area options are displayed, you will see a further two search bars shown below this.  The first called 'Custom field filters'.  This lets you select additional filtering options, from fields unique to your orgainsation (This also means this section may be empty).  Click the 'Fetch data' button to show records matching these filters.

__Display additional columns__

The second search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  Clicking on here will allow you to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your evaluation records.

__Saving your view__

You can adjust the columns shown in the table, by right clicking in the headings row of the table.  This will show you a list of rows.  Ticked rows are shown, and unticked rows are hidden.  You can change this by clicking on the item you wish to show or hide. If you wish to make that change the default view, click again and from the bottom of the pop-up list, choose 'Save table columns layout'.  This will now be shown as the default view for you.  This only affects you, and not the rest of your team.  Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the system standard.  (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, these can also be saved.)

__Downloading and printing the table__

If you wish to download the information in the table into a spreadsheet, click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table'.  Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose.
