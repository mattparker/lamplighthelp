To view all records in a {{linked case}}, find a record in that {{linked case}}, right-click and select 'View {{linked case}} details'. 

Alternatively within the admin settings you can enable the {{linked case}} view to be accessible from within a profile. Your system administrator will need to make this change. Go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings and on the 'data display options' tick 'Do you want data tables to display {{linked case}} details'. 

When you open a profile, an extra tab will appear 

![Viewing all {{linked case}} records]({{imgpath}}100a.png)

Click on a button on the left-hand side to view details of a particular {{linked case}}.
