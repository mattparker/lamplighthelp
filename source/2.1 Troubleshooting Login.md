# 2.1 Troubleshooting Login


1. When you see a &#039;login failed&#039; error message below the sign-in boxes, the database does not recognise either your username or your password. Try logging in again to see if your email or password were entered incorrectly the first time

2. If this doesn’t help you can change your password by clicking on the ‘Forgotten your password?’ link and following the instructions
For more on changing your password see section 16.1 Changing Passwords.
3. If you have further problems, check with your System Administrator that you are using the correct username, or if you have been locked out of the system for some reason
