# 2.1 Troubleshooting Login


1. When you see a &#039;login failed&#039; error message below the sign-in boxes, the database does not recognise either your username or your password. Try logging in again to see if your email or password were entered incorrectly the first time

2. If this doesn’t help you can change your password by clicking on the ‘Forgotten your password?’ link and following the instructions
For more on changing your password see section 16.1 Changing Passwords.

4. If you have further problems, check with your System Administrator that you are using the correct username
   
5. If you have been locked out of the system for some reason when you try and log in you will be directed to this screen

This could be because you’ve tried to log in to your account ten times without success. Failed attempts don’t all have to be at once, so can be across several sessions, days or weeks. This is a security feature to stop other people from repeatedly trying to guess your password.

The other reason for a lockout is when your System Administrator has set up login security policies which mean that you can't log in at this time or from the IP address of the computer that you are using.

6. If you see this message please see your System Administrator who will be able to unlock your account.

Once it has been unlocked you will only have one chance to log in correctly before being locked out again. This is a security feature to stop unauthorised access to your account. 

If you fail to log in correctly the first time, you will need to ask your System Administrator to unlock the account again. Once you have successfully logged in to your account, the counter is reset to ten failed log-in attempts before you are locked out again.

There is information on lockouts in section for System Administrators on unlocking an account in section [102.4 System Administration - Lockouts](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/102.4).
