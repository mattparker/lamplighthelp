- If you want to edit the record click 'edit'. This will open up the {{outcome}} record and you can alter the necessary details (see [8.1.0 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Menu Bar](/help/index/p/8.1.0) for more on the tabs in the {{outcome}} record).
- To delete the record, click 'delete' on the context menu.
