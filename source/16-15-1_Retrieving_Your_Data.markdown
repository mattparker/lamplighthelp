# 16.15.1 <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> Retrieving Your Data

> There are a number of different ways to retrieve large amounts of information from Lamplight. The one you choose will depend on what information you want and how accessible it needs to be



If you choose to close your account, the end of our Hosting Agreement with you will mean that we no longer have permission to store your data and it will be deleted from the servers. After 28 days our back-ups will also be removed.  

If you want us to retain your data, with the option to turn it back on in Lamplight at a later date, the Archive Module allows this. 
You can also download your data in various ways so that you retain the information when Lamplight is switched off. 

### Archiving Your System

The Archive Module allows us to retain your data, as we will still have a Hosting Agreement in place with your organisation. You can then access it once a month for up to 3 days. Your hosting fees are reduced to £5 per month per project (+ VAT), and we'll retain your data on our secure, backed-up servers. This may assist in a time of transition, or when pausing projects which may re-start.

### Downloading Your Information

#### Human usable back-ups (readable in Excel etc.)

You can use various methods to download your information in full:
   - Using {{group}}s with data views to show profile and {{activity}} information (see [12.0.0 {{Group}}s](/help/index/p/12.0.0) and [13.0.0 {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/13.0.0)).
   - Downloading {{activity}} records ({{work}}, {{referral}} etc.) with additional columns to show contents (see [7.3.0 Viewing All {{Work}} Records](/help/index/p/7.3.0)).
   - Downloading ‘Complete Reponses’ in {{eval}} reports (see [15.2.0 {{Eval}} Reports](/help/index/p/15.2.0)).
   
#### MySQL back-up
   You can also download a full copy of your system in MySQL format in the system admin area of Lamplight (see [16.15.0 Backups](/help/index/p/16.15.0)). This is a full (unencrypted) back-up, but not easy to use directly (you can't just open the file and see the data tables). Lamplight could potentially restore your system from this (though this would incur a charge to cater for adjustments), or it can be imported into a MySQL instance of your own.  We encourage you to download this as it gives you options should you need full access in the future, for example, for a safeguarding issue. 

**Please remember, if you do download a backup file or other personally identifiable data, you will need to make sure that it is properly encrypted and stored securely.**
