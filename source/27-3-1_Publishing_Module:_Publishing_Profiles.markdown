# 27.3.1 Publishing Module: Publishing Profiles

> With the publishing module you have the opportunity to publish profiles from your {{Lamplight}} database onto a public facing site 

As part of the initial set-up your system administrator will have specified the type of profiles they are happy for {{Lamplight}} to publish and what information should be published from within them (see section [24.5.0  System Administration - publishing module](/help/index/p/24.5.0)). It may just be an organisation's name and telephone number, but you could publish a range of other information about them as well.

As database operators you have the ability to specify whether a specific profile is published.

By default, no profiles are published. 

**To publish a {{person}} or {{org}}'s profile:**

- Go to their profile (see section [8.1.0  Finding {{people}}](/help/index/p/8.1.0) for information about profiles) 
- Click on the 'Publishing' tab.  
- In this tab you will be able to see whether the profile can be published, whether it is currently published, and whether the profile can be updated via the Publishing API.
- Find the field 'Currently published (double click to edit)', and double click over the word 'No' (if it says yes then this profile is already published).
- Tick the box.

- The profile is now being shared with the public-facing site. The publishing tab within the profile displays the information being shared. Any alterations to the information being published will need to be done from within the tab where that data sits usually, with the exception of the 'Publish summary' field, which you can double-click to alter and save.

**To remove sharing from a profile:**

- In the 'Publishing' tab, find the field 'Currently published (double click to edit)'.
- Double click over the word 'Yes'.
- Untick the box.

These changes will take XXXXXXXXXX to show on your public-facing site.
