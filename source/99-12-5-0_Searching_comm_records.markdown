# 12.5.0    Searching {{comm}} records

> The search bar at the top of the screen searches {{comm}} records for the text you enter. Alternatively click {{work}} -> view -> {{comm}}s on the main menu to search by date. Searching is only available if you have the {{comm}}s module. 

{{Comm}}s are only stored if you have the {{comm}}s module enabled.

If you want to search {{comm}} records using a free text search (for example, to search for text in the {{message}} content), use the search box on the main menu. If you type in the text you wish to search for and click the 'go' button {{Lamplight}} will carry out a full-text search of the system. See section [4.2.0  Menu Search Bar](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.2.0) for more information on full-text searching.
