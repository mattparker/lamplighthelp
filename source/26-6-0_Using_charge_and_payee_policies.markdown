# 26.6.0    Using charge and payee policies

> Charge and payee policies are used when you create {{work}} records. In addition to the usual tabs, you will see a 'Charges' tab with two drop-downs: 'select charging policy for this record' and 'select payee policy for this record'. 

Charge and payee policies are used when you create {{work}} records. In addition to the usual tabs, you will see a 'Charges' tab with two drop-downs: 'select charging policy for this record' and 'select payee policy for this record'.

If you don't see this tab, or the drop-downs are empty, you will need to create some policies - start at section [26.2.0  Setting up rules and policies](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.2.0) for help on how to do this. 

Just select the policies you wish to use for this {{work}} record. When you save the record {{Lamplight}} will calculate charges for each person listed on the attendance tab, and then determine who will pay them. When the record has saved, you will see this information in summary in the attendance section:

Because the 'other payees' may be any number of {{people}}, they are combined for the sake of brevity in this view. See section [26.6.1  Viewing payments due from a particular {{person}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.6.1) for help on seeing how charges are allocated. 

If you later edit or delete this record, the charges and payees may also change. If the payments due change, {{Lamplight}} will either update them, or create a credit if the charge has already been invoiced (see section [26.6.2  Creating invoices in bulk](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.6.2)).
