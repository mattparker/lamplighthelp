# 26.0.0 The Matching Module

> The matching module adds 'brokerage' functionality to {{Lamplight}}: match people to a {{volunteering_opportunity}} based on their location, interests and availability


### Module overview

The matching module would be a suitable for those managing services such as: 
- volunteering centre (matching volunteers to volunteering opportunities),
- befriending (matching befrienders to those seeking support),
- employment (matching jobseekers to employment opportunities),
- mentoring (matching mentors and mentees),
- specialist support,
- personal assistant/caring (matching carers to support needs).

The module is fully flexible and could be used whenever you have a pool of people to match to particular positions.

The process within {{Lamplight}} works like this:
- you create an '{{volunteering_opportunity}}' - this may be a volunteering placement; a job; or a support need
- there are '{{volunteering_application}}' from people - perhaps offering support; seeking employment; able to offer support
- each {{volunteering_opportunity}} and {{volunteering_application}} has a place; a time during the week when they are needed / available; and various categories describing them more fully.
- for any {{volunteering_opportunity}}, {{Lamplight}} can search for {{volunteering_application}} records that are good matches
- for any {{volunteering_application}}, {{Lamplight}} can search for {{volunteering_opportunity}} records that are good matches
- when you find a match that suits everyone you can record this in {{Lamplight}}.

You can also easily publish {{volunteering_opportunity}} records to a public website, if appropriate, so that potential {{volunteering_applicant}}s can search on your own website.

You can {{report}} on the {{volunteering_opportunity}} and {{volunteering_application}} records in your system, and matching between them.  {{Report}}s such as the number of matching {{volunteering_opportunity}} records registered/requested, number of successful placements/matches made and, for example the number of different people involved. With a variety of presentation options, these {{report}}s can also be broken down in different ways, such as by demographic data.
