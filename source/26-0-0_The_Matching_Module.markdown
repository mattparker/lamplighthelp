# 26.0.0 The Matching Module

> The matching module allows you to connect people to others or individuals to opportunities they wish to apply for. People can register their preferences and with the module, Lamplight will search the criteria to identify possible matches



This would be a suitable module for those managing: 
- volunteers (matching volunteers to volunteering opportunities).
- befriending.
- employment.
- mentoring.
- specialist support.
- personal assistant/caring.

### Module Features
Profiles for both parties would be added to Lamplight, with either the requirements or preferences added. Once in place, the matching function searches the system to identify matches in a range of criteria, for example:
- location.
- interests.
- availability.

If using the module for employment/volunteering opportunities, it enables you to publish the opportunities to your website.
Full reporting on the module enables you to accurately demonstrate the matching relationships made. Reports such as the number of matching opportunities registered/requested, number of successful placements/matches made and, for example the number of different people involved. With a variety of presentation options, these reports can also be broken down in different ways, such as by demographic data.
