# 4.2.0 My {{User}}s

> 'My {{user}}s' are the {{user}}s you {{work}} with most often



There will often be {{user}}s, {{contact}}s or {{funder}}s that you {{work}} with regularly. Rather than searching for them or browsing through long lists, you can create a 'My {{user}}' relationship with them, and they will then be listed in the 'My {{user}}s' tab on your home page. 

(If the 'My {{user}}s' tab doesn't appear on your home page, you may need to enable it in your personal settings - see [16.4.1 Personal Settings - Logging in and General Settings](/help/index/p/16.4.1).)

The relationship between you and your {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} will need to be set up in the 'Relationships' tab on the profile.  See section [5.4.0 The Relationships Tab](/help/index/p/5.4.0) for more information on how to do this. 

Once the tab is visible and a relationship has been created, you can use the tab to see all the {{people}} or {{org}}s who have a My {{user}} relationship to you, almost like your own personal address book. To view more about any of the {{user}}s in the list, you can left click on their name in the table to open their profile, or right click to bring up a menu with a range of options:

![My {{user}}s](38a.png) 

 - View full details - opens the user profile.
 - Edit - allows you to edit the relationship. 
 - Reverse - allows you to reverse the relationship (so if you have a manager/staff relationship, for example - this allows you to switch which person in the manager, and which the staff member).
 - Close relationship - removes the relationship from the list, but not from the system.
 - Communicate - opens a new {{comm}} page where you can send an email, text or write a letter (you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module).
 - Copy address from.... - It is unlikely that you will need to use this when looking in the My {{user}}s tab, as choosing this option will copy the address details of this {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} into the Contact Details tab on your own profile, replacing your current details. It is not possible to undo this action. 
 
You can also customise what columns you see in the table in the 'My {{user}}s' tab using a {{group}} data view. For more on using data views in this way, see [16.4.2 Personal Settings - Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2).
