# 4.2.0    My {{User}}s

> My {{user}}s are the {{user}}s you {{work}} with most often 

There will often be {{user}}s, {{contact}}s or {{funder}}s that you {{work}} with regularly. Rather than search for them every time or browse through long lists, you can set them up to appear on the 'My {{User}}s' tab on your homepage. It will allow you to have easy access to their contact details and profiles. 

(If the My {{User}}s tab doesn't appear on your homepage, you may need to enable it in your personal settings - see [16.4.1  Personal Settings - Logging in and General Settings](/help/index/p/16.4.1).)

The relationship between you and your {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} will need to be set up in the Relationship tab on the profile.  See section [5.4.0 The Relationships Tab](/help/index/p/5.4.0) for more information on how to do this. 

Once the tab is visible and a link has been created you can use the tab, almost like your own personal address book, which is specific for your work. To view more about any of the {{user}}s in the list, right click with your mouse on their name in the table. This will bring up a menu with a range of options:

 - View full details - opens the user profile.
 - Edit - allows you to edit the relationship. 
 - Reverse - allows you to reverse the relationship (so if you have a manager/staff relationship, for example - this allows you to switch which person in the manager, and which the staff member).
 - Close relationship - removes the relationship from the list, but not from the system.
 - Communicate - opens a new {{comm}} page where you can send an email, text or write a letter (you will only see this if you have the {{Comm}}s Module).
 - Copy address from.... - copies the address details of this {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} into the Contact Details tab on your own profile.
