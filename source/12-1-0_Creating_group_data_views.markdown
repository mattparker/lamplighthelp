# 12.1.0    Creating {{Group}} Data Views

> You can set up as many {{group}} data viwes as you need in {{Lamplight}}, and each one can be used with any {{group}}. Like {{group}}s, the ones that you create will show in a list for any database operator on your system to use

To add a new {{group}} data view:

- On the main menu, go to '{{group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> add.

When you enter the new {{group}} data view screen, you will see a screen like the one below:

-  There are a number of tabs. Some of the ones you see (for example Evalusations and Communications) will depend on the modules that you have on your system. Apart from the 'View name' tab, you only need to edit the ones which contain information that you want to include in your data view. 
  - View name. This is the only tab that you must complete - both the name and description are required fields. When you view the table of data views in the future the name is what you will see, so try and choose something that will remind you and other people what it's for in the future. 
  - Contact details. This is where you can select which contact information you'd like to see. Please note that if you use this {{group}} data view to view a {{group}}, the {{person}}/{{org}}'s name will already appear by default so you won't need to select it from here.
  - {{User}} fields, {{Staff}} fields, {{Funder}} fields and {{Contact}} fields. The information in these tabs relates to the fields from the tabs your {{people}}/{{org}}s use in profiles. The options within these pages will be unique to your system, as they were set-up and designed by your System Administrators.
- Relationships. YOu can show information in your data view about the named individual/{{org}} that {{people}} or {{org}}s in the {{group}} are linked to. Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see the 'name only' of the linked profile, or 'name and contact details'.
  - {{Work}} and {{Outcome}}s tabs. These mean that you can use general information (for example number of records in the last month), but also detailed information. Please note that detailed summary figures can take dates and workareas into account, see the image below.

**{{Referral}}s, {{Comm}}s, {{Eval}}s, {{Grant}}s, {{Linked case}}s tabs:** lets you add summary details about {{referral}}s, {{comm}}s, {{eval}}s, {{grant}}s and {{linked case}}s (if you have those modules enabled).

**Project sharing:** allows you to share the {{group}} data view with other projects, if you are a multi-project set-up and you have access to other projects.

**Blank column(s)** means you can add blank columns to your {{group}} data views, perhaps useful if you are using {{group}} data views for a register and you need a 'signed' column. If you wish to add more than one custom column, separate them by using a semi-colon (;).

Simply select the information you require.

When you have added all the information you wish to see, click the 'save' button in the bottom- right.
