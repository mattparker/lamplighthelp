5. There are three options once you&#039;ve completed your {{comm}}:
- The 'test' button will produce a test version of the document, or for emails will send a copy to your own email address. Do not navigate away from the 'Message content' tab in {{Lamplight}} while you look at it so that you can make any amendments before sending.
- The ‘Save but do not send’ button only works if you have the {{Comm}}s Module, so that you can create drafts and return to them later.
- Click 'Create/Send' to create the document or send the email.

- If you have created email, this will send directly from your account. (Please note, you will need to have added your email settings in the system admin section for this to {{work}}.
  
- Please note, if you do not have the {{Comm}}s Module your {{comm}} will not be saved in the system. For more on the module, please see [19 {{Comms}} Module](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/19).
