**Your actual message text is entered in the 'Message content' tab**

2. Click in the text box to create your {{comm}} content

- If you are creating mailing labels, you’ll see a mail-merge address block is already present in the text box. You can
  edit this if you choose, but don’t need to do anything else.
- For letters and emails you can click on the + in the top right of the text box, which will reveal the rich text
  editing tools.

3. There are also some buttons in the rich text editor which will help format your text:

- You can copy and paste into the text box. We recommend pasting as plain text, or pasting the text into Notebook first,
  and then copying from there, to make sure that any existing html formatting is removed. The text editor will try to
  filter extra code, which can have unexpected results.

4. For the content of the communication, you can use the mail merge fields add in information from the profile

- If you have chosen to send a separate letter or email to each person, you can use the ‘Profile Merge’ drop-down menu.
  It contains a number of fields which you can add so that your message autofills information. Choose them from the
  drop-down list and use them in your text as you would actual content. For example, I can write ‘Dear (space), select
  ‘first name’ from the drop-down list before moving to the next line. When merged, ‘First name’ will be replaced by the
  name of each person you send your email to.

5. There are three options once you&#039;ve completed your {{comm}}:

- The 'test' button will produce a test version of the document, or for emails will send a copy to your own email
  address. Do not navigate away from the 'Message content' tab in {{Lamplight}} while you look at it so that you can
  make any amendments before sending.
- The ‘Save but do not send’ button only works if you have the {{Comm}}s Module, so that you can create drafts and
  return to them later.
- Click 'Create/Send' to create the document or send the email.

- If you have created email, this will send directly from your account. (Please note, you will need to have added your
  email settings in the system admin section for this to {{work}}.

- Please note, if you do not have the {{Comm}}s Module your {{comm}} will not be saved in the system. For more on the
  module, please see [19 the {{comms}} module](/help/index/p/19) pages.
