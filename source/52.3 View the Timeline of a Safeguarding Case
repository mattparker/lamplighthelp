# 52.3 View the Timeline of a {{Safeguarding Case}}

> {{Safeguarding case}}s have a timeline of the actions carried out on that {{safeguarding case}}. They are shown below the main actions panel
under the 'Case Notes and Actions' heading.

All changes to the {{safeguarding case}} are logged within it and appear in a timeline below the main description of the {{safeguarding case}}. The
earliest actions are shown first. This gives you a full history of the investigation at a glance and provides an audit
trail should it be required.

It’s important to understand that you don’t edit records in the usual sense. Any changes are actions and notes cannot
be amended, only commented on. For more information on how to do this see [52.2.3 Proceeding with a 
{{Safeguarding Case}} - Actions](/help/index/p/52.2.3).

Within the timeline there are two types of entry: 

1. System entries show actions carried out (e.g. changes in status), they show the process of the {{safeguarding case}}

2. User entries are comments and notes, the substantive information about the {{safeguarding case}}

You can show or hide system entries in the timeline by clicking the 'Toggle message display' button in the 'Utilities' box.

Whether these system entries are visible when you first view a {{safeguarding case}} depends on the global settings in your system.
A system administrator can set this depending on your requirements.
