The order in which the records are displayed can be changed by clicking on the column headings. The default setting for viewing {{work}} records is 5 to a page but more or less can be viewed at once. Alternatively you can use the page numbers to move through the records.

The name of the {{workarea}}, a summary of what was done, the number of other people listed in the attendance register and the number of those attending who were service users/clients is displayed. Information about which {{linked case}} a piece of {{work}} was part of may also be shown, depending on your system settings. You may also have other information available or displayed - right-click on the green header of the table to see other information you can view.

To add a new piece of {{work}} click on the Add button on the right hand side of the screen. For more on creating new {{work}} records see section [9.1.0  Adding a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.0) .

To view a {{work}} record right click on the row in the table showing the {{work}} record you would like to see. This gives you a range of options.
