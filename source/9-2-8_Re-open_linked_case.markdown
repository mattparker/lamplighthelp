# 9.2.8    Re-open {{linked case}}

> If you do need to add a record to a closed {{linked case}}, you need to re- open it first. 

To re-open a closed {{linked case}}, click 're open {{linked case}}' in the context menu. See section [13.6.0  Re-opening a closed {{linked case}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.6.0) for more about open and closed {{linked case}}s.

If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is already open, you cannot re-open it, and the option will be disabled.
