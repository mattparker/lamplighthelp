# 16.8.1 Merging Duplicate Profiles

> Every {{person}} or {{org}} should only have one profile in {{Lamplight}}. If you find you have duplicates these can be merged by an administrator 

In System administration, go to the Data management section and click on the Find and merge duplicate profiles link.

You can choose what criteria you use to find duplicates, whether it's all or part of a profile name or address.

Once the system has searched for profiles, all possible duplicates using the criteria you selected are listed in the destination profile drop down.

When you select a profile to merge the source profile drop down will change to match.

xxxxx Add picture herexxxxxxx 
 
For each tab that appears in the two profiles you will be asked how you want to merge them. When you have made your selection click on the 'Merge this section now' button.

The source profile (which is the one that will be archived once the profiles are merged) is always the one listed on the right. The destination profile (which is the one which you will keep once the profiles are merged) will always be the one on the left. The data that you see on the left-hand side of the screen once when you are merging sections is the data that will ultimately be kept in the profile for that person.

When you have merged each section you can return to the top of the View and merge profiles section and delete the source profile.
