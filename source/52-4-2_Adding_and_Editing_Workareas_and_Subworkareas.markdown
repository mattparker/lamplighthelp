# 52.4.2 Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s and {{Subworkarea}}s

> You can change the {{workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s in system administration. This can be useful if you're adding a new workstream, for example

### Script

We’ve made a few changes to how you add, edit, delete and move your {{workarea}}s in system admin. 

Previously, when you went to the page in system admin it looked like this. You’d see a list of your {{workarea}}s with the {{subworkarea}}s below them.

They are still organised in much the same way, but when you open the page it will look different. There is a coloured list of all your {{workarea}}s, and when you click on one of these you see the {{subworkarea}}s appear below them.

#### Adding New {{Workarea}}s  

To add a new {{workarea}}, go to the buttons at the top of the page. If you are just adding one, click the ‘add new {{workarea}}’ button (Staff training).  A pop-up box will appear, and you can add the name in the ‘Text’ box, then choose the colour. Under this, if you have {{project}}s, you can choose which ones the {{workarea}} is visible to. Click ‘update’ when you have finished. 

If you have more than one {{workarea}}, you may choose to add them all at once by clicking the ‘bulk add {{workarea}}’ button. This opens a text box where you can add in any new {{workarea}}s you need, each one separated by a semi-colon. Click ‘add all’ to add them to the list. You will need to be aware that so far you only have names for these, so you will need to edit each one separately to choose colours and which {{project}}s they relate to. To do this, find the new {{workarea}} in the list then click on the pen and paper item to the right of it. 

#### Adding New {{subworkarea}} Activities  

{{subworkarea}}s are now called ‘Activities’ on this page to make it clearer how they are used in Lamplight. To add new ones, find the {{workarea}} that you need in the list and click on it. If there are already {{subworkarea}}s attached to this {{workarea}} they will be listed below it. If not you will see the option to click ‘add new activity’ to get started. Choosing this option will open a text box where you can type in the name of your {{subworkarea}}, or ‘activity’. Press ‘update’ when you have finished. 
You will also see a button at the top to ‘bulk add activities’. You can use this to add more than one activity to the same {{workarea}}. Just enter each into the text box, separated by a semi-colon. When you click ‘add all’ they will appear at the bottom of the list.
Do remember, as with other lists, none of your changes have been finally saved until you click on ‘save all changes’ at the top or bottom of the page. 

#### Editing, Moving and Deleting  

You also have buttons to the right of each {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}} activity which allow you to move and delete them. For {{workarea}}s these start with a ‘more details’ button, which will open the list of {{subworkarea}} activities. There are then up and down buttons which allow you to customise the list order, an edit button with a pen and paper icon which you can use to edit the name (we only recommend this if it is to correct a spelling error or make the category more clear – for more on this see our help pages)
Finally we have a delete button. When you choose to delete a {{workarea}} then all the {{subworkarea}} activities beneath it will be deleted too. We have more information on this in section 16.6.1 of our help pages.  When you choose to ‘delete’ an item it will become faded with a pink bar under it. If you did this by mistake then press the ‘delete’ button again to return it to normal. The item will not be permanently deleted until you press the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page. Once you have done this then you can’t change your mind again.  

The {{subworkarea}} activities have the same buttons to the right of them, except for the ‘more details’ button. 

You will also see at the top of the {{workarea}} list a ‘sort’ option, which will put all your {{workarea}}s in alphabetical order. Click again to arrange them in reverse order. 

There is this same option at the top of each list of {{subworkarea}} activities which will reorder them within that {{workarea}}. (It’s not possible to move {{subworkarea}} activities between {{workarea}}s.)  

Once you’ve finished editing, please do remember to ‘save all changes’ before leaving the page.  

If you need to know more details, you can find them in section 16.6.1 of our help pages.
