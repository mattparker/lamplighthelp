# 51.5.0 {{Outcome}}s

> The {{Outcome}}s tab is where you can record data on the difference that you are making over time to the {{people}} and {{org}}s that you work with. 

Your organisation will have decided on the {{outcome}}s that are available in your system. Each set of {{outcome}}s will be recorded on a numerical scale (for example 1â€“5), or have yes/no answers.
