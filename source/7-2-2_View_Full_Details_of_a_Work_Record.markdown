> Choosing to 'View full details' will show you all the information you entered in a {{Work}} record including when it happened, where, and who was there



To view all details of a {{work}} record:

- Find it in the table on the {{Work}} records tab (for more on this see [7.2.0 Viewing {{Work}} Records for an Individual](/help/index/p/7.2.0).
- Right click on it in the table, or click on the context menu button to the left. [Context menu](7.2.2b.png)
- From the pop-up menu, choose 'view full details'. 

A popup window will appear displaying the full record. 

- If you see details in this record that are not correct, there is an 'Edit' button at the top right of the page, where you can open the record to amend the information (for more on editing {{work}} records, see [7.2.1 Edit a {{work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.2.1)).
- Please also note that more maybe visible to you than the image below shows. For example if you add {{message}}s within records, they too will appear here. You can view {{message}}s saved, add new ones (via the 'add row' option) and mark any as complete. For more details on {{Message}}s please see [4.3 My {{Message}}s](/help/index/p/4.3))
