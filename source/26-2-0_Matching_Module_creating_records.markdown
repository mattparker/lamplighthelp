# 26.2.0 Matching Module - Creating Records

> You need to create {{volunteering opportunity}} and {{volunteering application}} records. You can then use these to match the volunteers to the opportunities

The Matching Module works by matching {{volunteering application}} records to {{volunteering opportunity}} ones. These records are linked to profiles for {{people}} or {{organisation}}s - both those offerening the opportunities and those applying to fill the roles. 

Creating {{volunteering opportunity}} records is covered in [section 26.2.1](/help/index/p/26.2.1) and {{volunteering application}} records in [section 26.2.2](/help/index/p/26.2.2).  Both are a type of {{activity}} record and are similar to {{work}} and {{referral}} records.

One profile can have any number of {{volunteering opportunity}} records, as well as any number of {{volunteering application}} records.
