#  5.6.3 Restricted Processing of Profiles

> If a {{person}} requests that processing of their data is restricted, it is possible to ensure this in Lamplight.

'Restricted processing' is a particular right for data subjects under the GDPR (art 10(1)(a)-(d). If a data subject requests that processing is restricted then their data can still be stored but can't be processed unless it is with their consent or relates to legal claims, the rights of others or reasons of important public interest. 

**To restict processing**

Open the relevant profile and click the ‘restrict processing’ button on the right-hand side of the
profile:

When you click this button, you will be asked to confirm that you wish to
restrict processing. Click yes and the profile status will be changed, and you will
go back to the home page.

Once you have restricted processing of a profile, you will not be able to:
- Edit the profile
- See them in searches
- Find them in {{list}} views
- See them in {{groups}}
- Include them in {{reports}}
- See them in records

**Viewing restricted profiles**

System administrators can view restricted profiles. 

Go to {{people}} > view and in the search bar above the table set ‘Limit list to’ ‘People restricted for processing’. Click the ‘fetch
data’ button. This will allow you to find profiles again where the processing restriction needs to be lifted.

From here you can click on the name in the table to view the profile. You will see a warning message:




If the restriction needs to be lifted and the data subject has been notified that it will be, you can ‘Allow processing’ by clicking the button.
