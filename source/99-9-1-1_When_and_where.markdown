# 9.1.1    When and where

> The When and where tab stores information about when and where the piece of {{work}} happened. 

The date and {{workarea}} fields on the when and where tab are required, and the date to must be after the date from. The time by default is set to an hour after the start time. If you wish this to be different for your system, your system administrator can make this change in 'Global settings'.  If you change the date, this will reset the time to one hour.

When selecting a {{workarea}}, you must select one {{workarea}}, and any number of {{subworkarea}}s. To add a {{workarea}}, click on the appropriate radio button / {{work area}}

You can add a {{subworkarea}} once you have selected a work area.  The {{subworkarea}}s for the {{workarea}} you have chosen will appear to the right hand side.  You simply select the {{subworkarea}} or {{subworkarea}}s you require.  Click on them a second time to deselect.

You can select as many locations as necessary, just select another option from the list. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect.
