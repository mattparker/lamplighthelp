# 52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers can view and create {{report}}s of all {{safeguarding case}}s broken down in various ways.

To view and create {{safeguarding}} {{report}}s:

1. Go to '{{Report}}s'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 1](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_1.png)

2. Click on '{{safeguarding}} {{report}}' or scroll down to the '{{Safeguarding}} {{report}}' section manually 
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 2](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_2.png)

3. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 3](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_3.png)

    - view an existing {{report}} template
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 4](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_4.png)

    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 5](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_5.png)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{safeguarding}} {{report}} using your own criteria'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 6](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_6.png)

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields, you will be able to decide how these date fields
are handled a little later in the '{{Report}} presention' section (by default the {{report}} will look at the last month to date)

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 

7. Most of the filters are the same as for other {{report}}s (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1))

8. However, there are specific filters for {{safeguarding case}} fields allowing you to filter your {{report}} further. These are:

    - 'Show open or closed {{safeguarding cases}}'
    - 'Status of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    - 'Severity rating of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    - 'Closure outcome of {{safeguarding case}}'

9. There is also an 'Additional fields' section which includes any custom {{safeguarding case}} fields that have been set up in your system
by your system admins, you may not have any of these

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

10. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data

11. You will see options under ‘How should dates be handled?’ giving you a choice of how the dates you 
have chosen at the top are used by the {{report}}:

    - Include {{safeguarding case}}s that were open during the period: will include all {{safeguarding case}}s that were open at any point during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened (created) during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened and closed during the period: : will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were both opened and closed during the date range

12. You will also see a field called 'How should rows be grouped'. The options in this drop-down come from your {{safeguarding case}} 
fields as well as profile information. If you choose one of these {{Lamplight}} will display the information in additional table rows

13. To view the {{report}} click the 'run {{report}}' button

14. The {{report}} results will display in a table

15. If you run your {{report}} grouped by {{safeguarding case}} (this is the default) then each new row will be a 
{{safeguarding case}} and you will have the following columns in your table:

    - {{Safeguarding case}} ID
    - {{Safeguarding case}} name
    - Date {{safeguarding case}} opened
    - {{Safeguarding case}} open
    - Date {{safeguarding case}} closed
    - Length of {{safeguarding case}} (weekdays)
    - Length of {{safeguarding case}} (days)
    - Summary time, the total time spent on the {{safeguarding case}} in hours (this is the duration of any records in the {{safeguarding case}})
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}} notes in period

16. If you run your {{report}} grouped by one of the other {{safeguarding case}} or profile fields in the drop down list, such as 
severity or gender, you will have the following columns in your table:

    - Number of {{safeguarding case}} notes in period
    - The field you have chosen to group by, for instance severity or gender
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}}s open during the period
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}}s opened during the period
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}}s still open now
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}}s that are closed now
    - Number of {{safeguarding case}}s closed during the period
    - Total days the {{safeguarding case}}s were open for
    - Total time spent on records in the {{safeguarding case}}s (all dates), in hours
    - Total days {{safeguarding case}}s have been dormant
