# 52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers can view and create {{report}}s of all {{safeguarding case}}s broken down in various ways.

To view and create {{safeguarding}} {{report}}s:

1. Go to '{{Report}}s'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 1](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_1.png)

2. Click on '{{safeguarding}} {{report}}' or scroll down to the '{{Safeguarding}} {{report}}' section manually 
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 2](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_2.png)

3. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 3](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_3.png)

    - view an existing {{report}} template
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 4](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_4.png)

    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 5](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_5.png)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{safeguarding}} {{report}} using your own criteria'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 6](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_6.png)

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields, you will be able to decide how these date fields
are handled a little later in the '{{Report}} presention' section (by default the {{report}} will look at the last month to date)
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 7](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_7.png)

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 8](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_8.png)

7. Most of the filters are the same as for other {{report}}s (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1))
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 9](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_9.png)

8. However, there are specific filters for {{safeguarding case}} fields allowing you to filter your {{report}} further. These are:

    - 'Show open or closed {{safeguarding cases}}'
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 10](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_10.png)

    - 'Status of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 11](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_11.png)

    - 'Severity rating of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 12](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_12.png)

    - 'Closure outcome of {{safeguarding case}}'
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 13](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_13.png)

9. There is also an 'Additional fields' section which includes any custom {{safeguarding case}} fields that have been set up in your system
by your system admins, you may not have any of these
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 14](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_14.png)
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 15](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_15.png)

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

10. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 16](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_16.png)

11. You will see options under ‘How should dates be handled?’ giving you a choice of how the dates you 
have chosen at the top are used by the {{report}}:

    - Include {{safeguarding case}}s that were open during the period: will include all {{safeguarding case}}s that were open at any point during the date range
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 17](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_17.png)

    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened (created) during the date range
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 18](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_18.png)

    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the date range
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 19](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_19.png)

    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened and closed during the period: : will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were both opened and closed during the date range
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 20](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_20.png)

12. You will also see a field called 'How should rows be grouped'. The options in this drop-down come from your {{safeguarding case}} 
fields as well as profile information. If you choose one of these {{Lamplight}} will display the information in additional table rows
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 21](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_21.png)

13. To view the {{report}} click the 'run {{report}}' button
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 22](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_22.png)

14. The {{report}} results will display in a table

15. If you run your {{report}} grouped by {{safeguarding case}} (this is the default) then each new row will be a 
{{safeguarding case}} and you will have the following columns in your table:
