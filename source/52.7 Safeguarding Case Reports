# 52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers can view and create reports of all {{safeguarding case}}s broken down in various ways.

To view and create {{safeguarding}} reports:

1. Go to 'Reports'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 1](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_1.png)

2. Click on '{{safeguarding}} report' or scroll down to the '{{Safeguarding}} report' section manually 
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 2](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_2.png)

3. Like other reports you have the the option to,

    - create a new report using your own critera
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 3](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_3.png)

    - view an existing report template
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 4](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_4.png)

    - create a new report template (if you are a system admin)
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 5](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_5.png)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Reports}} Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create report templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{safeguarding}} report using your own criteria'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} Reports - step 6](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_6.png)

***** UP TO HERE - go through each tab/option *****


The report is very like the {{linked case}} report. By default when you run the report you will see each {{safeguarding case}},
with various summary data about it.  This can be changed in the report presentation tab to show {{safeguarding case}}s grouped
by status, severity, or other attributes.

See [14.6.0 {{Linked case}} report](/help/index/p/14.6.0) for full help about the {{linked case}} report.
