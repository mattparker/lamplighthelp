# 52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers can view and create {{report}}s of all {{safeguarding case}}s broken down in various ways.

To view and create {{safeguarding}} {{report}}s:

1. Go to '{{Report}}s'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 1](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_1.png)

2. Click on '{{safeguarding}} {{report}}' or scroll down to the '{{Safeguarding}} {{report}}' section manually 
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 2](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_2.png)

3. Like other {{report}}s you have the the option to,

    - create a new {{report}} using your own critera
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 3](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_3.png)

    - view an existing {{report}} template
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 4](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_4.png)

    - create a new {{report}} template (if you are a system admin)
    ![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 5](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_5.png)

For more information on these three options see [35.1 {{Work}} {{Report}}s Overview](/help/index/p/35.1).
For more information on how to create {{report}} templates see [37 Reporting from Templates](/help/index/p/37).

4. Select the option 'New {{safeguarding}} {{report}} using your own criteria'
![52.7 {{Safeguarding Case}} {{Report}}s - step 6](52.7_Safeguarding_Case_Reports_im_6.png)

5. Select the timeframe you would like to report on using the two date fields, you will be able to decide how these date fields
are handled a little later in the '{{Report}} presention' section (by default the {{report}} will look at the last month to date)

6. Next click on '{{Report}} filters' and select the filters you would like included in your {{report}} 

7. Most of the filters are the same as for other reports (see [14.1.1 {{Report}} Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1))

8. However, there are specific filters for {{safeguarding case}} fields allowing you to filter your {{report}} further. These are:

    - 'Show open or closed {{safeguarding cases}}'
    - 'Status of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    - 'Severity rating of {{Safeguarding case}}'
    - 'Closure outcome of {{safeguarding case}}'

9. There is also an 'Additional fields' section which includes any custom {{safeguarding case}} fields that have been set up in your system
by your system admins, you may not have any of these

Note, if you do not choose anything from these fields then your {{report}} will return all information. It is only when you pick an 
option that {{Lamplight}} filters the information it returns.

10. Click on '{{Report}} presentation' to choose how to display your data

11. You will see options under ‘How should dates be handled?’ giving you a choice of how the dates you 
have chosen at the top are used by the {{report}}:

    - Include {{safeguarding case}}s that were open during the period: will include all {{safeguarding case}}s that were open at any point during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened (created) during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the period: will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were closed during the date range
    - Include only {{safeguarding case}}s that were opened and closed during the period: : will include any {{safeguarding case}}s that were both opened and closed during the date range

12. You will also see a field called 'How should rows be grouped'. The options in this drop-down come from your {{safeguarding case}} 
fields as well as profile information. If you choose one of these {{Lamplight}} will display the information in additional table rows

****** UP TO HERE ******

The {{report}} is very like the {{linked case}} {{report}}. By default when you run the {{report}} you will see each {{safeguarding case}}
with various summary data about it.  This can be changed in the report presentation tab to show {{safeguarding case}}s grouped
by status, severity, or other attributes.

See [14.6.0 {{Linked case}} report](/help/index/p/14.6.0) for full help about the {{linked case}} report.
