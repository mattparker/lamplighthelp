The options on the context menu relate to the row that you clicked on. Some of these menu items may be light grey, which means they are disabled. This is either because the option is not relevant (for example, you can't close a {{linked case}} that's already closed) or because you do not have high enough access rights (for example, you are not allowed to delete records).
