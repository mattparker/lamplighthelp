> You run all {{Lamplight}} {{report}}s from the main menu



When you want a {{report}}, the first thing you need to choose is what type you need. For example, it could be a report on your {{work}}, {{outcome}}s or {{referral}}s. Once you have decided:

- Click on '{{Report}}s' above the main menu bar.
- You will see the options appear in the menu bar. 
- Click on the option that you need. 
- If you see the word 'more...' on the menu bar, click on this to see further {{report}} options.
