# 3.1.0 The Main Menu

> The main menu at the top of the screen is the main way to navigate around the system. 

You will use the menu along the top of the screen to get around the system. 

The first line of menu items (starting with 'Home') can be clicked; this then displays the heading menu for that section in the coloured bar below.

(The categories that you see in your own system may differ to those shown in the picture above - this is due to each system beind customised for the organisation using it.)


If you click many of these headings a dropdown sub-menu will appear. Simply click on the sub-menu item to go to the page you need.

If you see a black arrow pointing to the right on the sub menu this will mean that there are more options to show. Just click on the arrow to display these.

Throughout this manual you will see instructions shown with an arrow, for example 'go to {{work}} -> view all on the main menu'. The arrow -> indicates the {{work}} sub- menu. 

You can also find out more about the main menu in our introductory training video below.
