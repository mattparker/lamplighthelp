# 13 Outcomes - Viewing An individual's Records

**The '{{Outcome}}s' tab in a {{person}}'s profile is where you can see the change they've experienced over time**

{{Outcome}}s scores already recorded for the individual or organisation are displayed on this tab. There are three different ways to show the information: a radar chart, in an advanced table, and in a normal table view. 

1. Click on {{Outcome}}s tab within a Profile

2. The Radar Chart
The radar chart shows the score for a single {{outcome}} measure on each axis. You can choose the {{outcome}} category you want to look at from the drop-down box directly above the chart. 

If scores have been entered for these {{outcome}}s, they will show on the chart. The position of the line shows the scores, and colour of the line matches to a box to the right of the chart, showing the date the score was added.

For example, the picture above shows the results in November (brown, inner line); February (pink line) and July (blue line). 'I've been feeling relaxed' has gone from a score of 3 in November (meaning they are not very relaxed) to a 5 in July (meaning their feeling of relaxation has increased). In general (assuming larger numbers are better) you will hope that the shapes made by the lines on the chart get gradually bigger as time goes on.

3. The Table
The table view at the bottom is for viewing the {{outcome}}s data that has been entered. It shows a record for each time that an {{outcome}}s measure has been scored. 

The 'Summary' column shows the measure and score for each record.

You can customise your table in the following ways:

b. Sort the table by clicking on the arrows next to column headers

If you use {{linked case}}s in your system, there more options (See section [9.0.0 {{Linked case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0) for more on {{linked case}}s):

- Link to {{linked case}}: You can add this {{outcome}} to a {{linked case}}. 

If you have the {{Comm}}s Module you will also see:
