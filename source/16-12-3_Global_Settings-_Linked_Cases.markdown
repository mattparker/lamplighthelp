# 16.12.3 Global Settings: {{Linked Case}}s

> {{Linked case}}s in Lamplight are a way to link different types of work in one place. This tab is where you can turn them on or off, depending on whether you need to use them, and also contains some settings for them



### Do you want to use {{linked case}}s at all?
{{Linked case}}s in Lamplight are a way to link different pieces of work. A {{linked case}} has a name, description and start and end dates. There are also three types of category that can be used to label {{linked case}}s - you can set these up in system administration. To do this, go to 'admin -> system administration -> Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down Lists -> {{Linked Case}}s. (For more on how to add items to a list in system administration, see [16.6.0 System Administration: Lists](/help/index/p/16.0.0).)

Any type of record or communication (if you have the communications module) can be added to a {{linked case}}, as well as records which relate to different {{workarea}}s.  For more on this see [9.0.0 {{Linked Case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0).

The options for this tab are:

- **Do you want to be able to set open dates of {{linked case}}s manually?**

   This option is enabled by default, so the start date of {{linked case}}s can be entered much like it is in {{work}} records. If the start date is always the date the {{linked case}} was entered on the system, or if it's not important to record a start date for a {{linked case}}, disabling this option will make data entry simpler when opening {{linked case}}s.
   
- **Do you want the {{linked case}} tab on profiles?**

   The ‘{{Linked case}} view’ tab on profiles allows you to see all the active and inactive {{linked case}}s in a profile, and all the records linked to them. You can also create new {{linked case}}s and link records to them here. If you are not using {{linked case}}s in this way, you can turn off this profile tab using this option. It is still possible to access {{linked case}}s through the main menu at '{{work}} -> view -> {{linked case}}s.
   
 - **If so, you can specify a custom template for the "unlinked records" button here**

   If you have the {{linked case}} tab enabled on profiles (see option above), there is a button above the list of {{linked case}}s that shows all records not included in a {{linked case}}. You can specify what details appear on this button using the codes outlined in the  menu.

- **Custom template for the open {{linked case}} buttons**

   As with the option above, you can choose details to appear on the open {{linked case}} buttons. You will need to have set up a custom template for unlinked records for this to take effect.
   
- **Custom template for the closed {{linked case}} buttons**

   As with the two options above, you can choose what is shown on the closed {{linked case}} buttons. Again, you will need to have set up the custom template for unlinked records for this to take effect.
