# 108.2 Archiving Profiles

**System Administrators and Managers can archive a profile once it is no longer active if you don't need to add information to it or amend information that is already in it**

Archiving is straightforward and reversable. When a profile is archived it can still be counted in {{report}}s (if the ‘Include archived profiles?’ field is selected on the report filters page, (for more on this see [14.1.1 Report Filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)). You can also run {{group}}s of archived {{people}} and {{org}}s. The profile itself will not be found if you use the search box at the top of the screen, or search boxes for attendance tables in {{activity}} records.  

**Only database operators with a Manager level of access to {{Lamplight}} or above will be able to archive, find, and unarchive profiles.**

**Finding an Archived Profile through the Duplicate Warning**

When you create a new profile you may receive a warning of possible duplicates already on the system. Lamplight checks new profiles against those with similar names to the one you&#039;re entering, including archived profiles.

![108.2 Archiving Profiles - step 11](108.2_Archiving_Profiles_im_11.png)

1. Check to see if the profile you are adding is in the {{group}}.
If you see that the profile you&#039;re adding is already on the system, click the name in the duplicates {{group}} to open the profile.

![108.2 Archiving Profiles - step 12](108.2_Archiving_Profiles_im_12.png)

2. Reinstating a profile
If you want to reinstate this profile (i.e. you are going to be adding data and records to it), click on Un-archive at the top right of the profile.

![108.2 Archiving Profiles - step 13](108.2_Archiving_Profiles_im_13.png)

**If you do not unarchive this profile, it will be possible to save information to it (including {{person}}al information and {{activity}} records), but as it will still be archived it will not be possible to find it using the search box at the top of the page.**
