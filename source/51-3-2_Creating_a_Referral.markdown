Welcome to {{Referral}}s, video 2 of 2, Entering and Editing a {{Referral}}.

Whenever you enter a record, you always use the first three tabs in the record, entering when and where it happened, who was involved, and the details of what happened.  We’ll start on the first tab, When and Where, and we’re going to enter a {{referral}} in to our organisation.

A quick reminder that you may have additional custom fields on any of your tabs that we don’t have.  A custom field is one created uniquely for your organisation, and so we can’t show the ones that you have in this video, though we’ll demonstrate some examples.  Speak to your system administrator or implementer if you have a question about these.

### When and Where

We start with the time and date.  For most organisations the time of your {{referral}} won’t matter, so you can ignore it.  The date shows by default as the day that you are adding it, and you can change this if needed.  If you have a ‘Date to’ field, the second date will normally be the same as the first.

- **{{Workarea}}s**

   Every time we enter a record we also have to select a {{workarea}}, and you’ll normally select a {{subworkarea}} too, although this is not mandatory.  We’ll talk about {{workarea}}s in more detail when looking at {{work}} records, but speak to your System Administrator or Implementer if you’re uncertain what to select here. In this case the {{referral}} I’m recording is for 1:1 support, and so I’ll go to the 1:1 support {{workarea}} then select ‘{{Referral}}’ as a {{subwork}} area. 
   
If you use locations you can also select a location here, although it’s not required.

### Switching Tabs

To move to the next tab, either click the ‘Next’ button in the bottom right, or at the top of the section select the next tab along. A quick tip, if you click the ‘Next’ button and see a blank screen, try scrolling up!

### Attendance

Your next tab may be called ‘Attendance’ or may use a simpler version called ‘Involving’.  Both tabs do the same job, allowing you to record who is involved in the {{referral}}.  In the same way as relationships, you can only add in profiles which are already in the system.

In the Attendance tab as shown on our system, you enter names using the ‘Find profiles’ box at the top of the section.  As with search boxes elsewhere in {{Lamplight}}, click into it, start entering the name of the person making the {{referral}} and then select them from the dropdown list.  As well as {{people}} and {{org}}s, you can also add groups or lists of {{people}} in one go, by typing the name of the group.  If you don’t know what a group is – don’t worry, you’ll cover it in our video on groups.

The table you can see in this tab shows you who is attending.  You’ll see that for your {{user}}, it shows their name, whether they attended or not, and their role, in this case ‘{{User}} referred’.

For a {{referral}} you need have up to three different profiles (which is to say, {{people}} or {{org}}s), attending or involved:
- The {{user}} being referred (they may already be in the table if you started from their profile)
- The {{person}} or {{org}} who is referring the {{user}}  (who will attend with the role ‘referrer’.)  Let’s enter in the name of our referrer now.
- Who they are being referred to, which in this case is our {{org}}.

Of course, if you are recording a {{referral}} out, some of these roles will be swapped.  For example, the {{referral}} would come from your organisation, making you the referrer, and the external organisation would be who they are being referred to.  Depending on your system set-up, you may make {{referral}}s from your organisation as a whole, or you may have different departments entered as separate profiles to refer from.  

Once you’ve entered the records check that each profile is shown as attending in the right capacity, by looking at the ‘role’ column in the attendance table.  You can change the role by left clicking on the name of the role in the table (for example {{user}} referred), and then clicking again to access the drop-down list and choosing a new option.

### Involving

If your tab is called ‘Involving’ instead of ‘Attendance’ then you have a simple version of recording who is involved in {{referral}}s.  You have a field or search box for each of the different roles: the person being referred, the referrer, and who they are being referred to.  Simply start to enter the appropriate profile names in each search box, and then choose the name you are looking for from the drop-down list that appears.

Now we’ll move to the next tab.

### Details

The third tab is the ‘Details’ tab.   As you would expect, we use this to record the detail of the {{referral}}.  Let’s look through the fields.
- {{Referral}} direction: This field records whether the {{referral}} is being made in to you, out to another organisation, or is an internal {{referral}}.  Recording this is often very important for your reporting.
- {{Referral}} reason: This is the equivalent of the subject line in your email.  It’s what appears when you look at the table of {{referral}}s to show you what’s been happening, and it’s normally best to keep it short, sweet, and to the point.
- {{Referral)) notes: This gives you a space to record any further details you need to note down.  This could be notes from your {{referral}} form or from a telephone conversation about the {{referral}}.  Simply pop them in here.
- {{Waiting list}}s:  If you have the {{waiting list}} module then you can add someone directly to a waiting list from the {{referral}}.  You’ll learn more about this in our {{waiting list}}s video.
- {{Referral}} success:  Most clients use this in some form.  This is a way of recording whether the {{referral}} has been accepted by you, or by the external agency.  Your options may simply be yes or no, or there may be additional ones for you to choose from.
- Finally, you may have some custom fields in this tab.  For example, a common one is ‘{{Referral}} {{org}} type’, which could let you report not just on exactly which Social Services referred to you, but how many social care organisations referred to you altogether.  If you have any doubt about any of your custom fields, do speak with a member of your team.

You may have some additional tabs in your {{referral}} record too.  Some may be custom tabs, and do look through these. Others, such as expenses or media, are tabs that come with particular modules, and we’ll go over these more as we go through the basic training.

It’s worth saying that while we’ve spent some time going through the details of each tab here, you’ll fly along once you get used to entering them.

As always, when you’ve finished creating your record, it’s important you go to the bottom right of the section, and click save, to save it to {{Lamplight}}.  

If you’ve entered the record from within a profile tab, when you save you’ll see the table showing you all of the {{referral}}s in and out for that {{person}}.  This table works in the same way as those for any other type of {{activity}} record, and we’ll cover this next, in {{work}} records.

You can go to any profile and see the table showing {{referral}}s they have been involved in in the same way.  So for example, you can also go to the {{referral}} tab in an {{org}}’s profile and see all of the {{referral}}s relating to them.

Before you watch the next video, why not create at least one {{referral}} in, and one {{referra}}l out, either in your own system or our test one?  You can pause the video and take a moment to try this.  See the next group of videos to learn about {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}.
