# 108.4 Restricted Processing of Profiles

**If a {{person}} requests that processing of their data is restricted, go to their profile and click the 'Restrict processing' button**

'Restricted processing' is a particular right for data subjects under the GDPR (art 10(1)(a)-(d)). If a data subject requests that processing is restricted then their data can still be stored but can't be processed unless it is with their consent or relates to legal claims, the rights of others or reasons of important public interest.  Further information about this is available on the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-restrict-processing/).

Important things to note about restricted profiles:

- They can be restricted and then unrestricted again.
- Only Manager or Admin level operators can do this.
- Restricted profiles are not included when doing any kind of reporting, or in searches.
- Restricted profile names will show in the duplicate checker.
- If you view a restricted profile it will say 'Restricted for Processing' very clearly across the top of the page.
