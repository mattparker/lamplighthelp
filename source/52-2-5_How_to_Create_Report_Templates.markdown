# 52.2.5 How to Create {{Report}} Templates

> If you have a {{report}} that you need to run regularly, it is possible to set it up as a template in 'system administration'. 

{{Lamplight}} will save your settings so that you can choose the {{report}} from a list the next time you want to run it. Only System Administrators will be able to set up a template {{report}}, but everyone with reporting access can use them.
