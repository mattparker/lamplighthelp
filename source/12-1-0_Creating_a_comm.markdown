# 12.1.0    Creating a {{comm}}

> To create a {{comm}}, go to {{Work}} -> {{comm}} -> create {{comm}} on the main menu. 

To create a {{comm}}, go to {{Work}} -> {{comm}} -> create on the main menu. You will see the main screen for creating {{comm}}s:

You will need to go through each tab to set the type of {{comm}}; the recipients; email details (if relevant); files to attach (if relevant); mailing label type (if relevant) and the {{message}} itself.

To test how your {{comm}} will look then you can click the 'test' button in the bottom right. A test letter or label will be created using your own profile information. A test email will be sent to your email address.

You can save your {{comm}} by clicking the 'save but do not send' button in the bottom right. This will create a draft {{comm}} record, which can be edited at a later date.

When you have added all information, click the 'create/send' button in the bottom right. If you have the {{comm}}s module enabled the details of the {{comm}} will be saved to the {{people}} it was sent to.

If you have the {{Comm}} module then you can create a {{comm}} from a {{group}} using the context menu. Creating a {{comm}} this way will automatically populate the recipients list with the members of the {{group}}.

If you have the {{Comm}} module then you can create a {{comm}} from a {{work}} record, using the context menu. Creating a {{comm}} this way will automatically populate the recipients list with the attendees of the {{work}} record. You can also use extra mail merge options ('happen merge') to include parts of the {{work}} record. (see section [9.2.10  {{Comm}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.10))
