# 30.2.0 {{Waiting List}}s Module: Managing {{Waiting List}}s from the Menu Bar

> Once you have {{waiting list}}s on your system, it's possible to manage them from the menu bar

### Finding a {{Waiting List}}

To view all {{waiting list}}s, on the main menu go to {{activity}} -> view -> {{waiting list}}s.

![Finding {{Waiting List}}s in the Main Menu](30.2.0a.png)

A table will display all the {{waiting list}}s that have been created, and their status.

As with other tables in {{Lamplight}} this might run to more than one page. You can choose to change the number of rows
shown using the drop-down box above the table. You can also sort the table by a specific column by clicking on the
column header.

### The {{Waiting List}} Menu

Each {{waiting list}} has a popup context menu which you can open by right-clicking on the list in the table or by
left-clicking the menu button to the left of it. There are a number of different options on this menu.

#### View full details

This shows you each {{person}} currently on the {{waiting list}}, the date they joined and the length of time they have
been on it. If there is a black arrow to the right of this row, there are {{group}} data views which you can use to see
more detail about the people on the {{waiting list}}. See
section [13.2.2 Using {{Group}} Data Views to Add Information to Attendance Tables](/help/index/p/13.2.2) for more
information.

#### Quick view in pop-up

This allows you to view the current members of the {{waiting list}} in a pop-up box. From here you can choose to
download the data into a spreadsheet or print it as a table if you want to. It will show you who is currently on the
{{waiting list}}, and how long they've been on it.

#### Historical view in pop-up

You can use this option to see an historical view which shows the details of all {{people}} and {{org}}s who have been
on the list, past and present. Again, this table can be downloaded or printed if required.

#### Edit

Database operators with a Manager level of access or above will be given the option to edit the {{waiting list}} (this
option is visible in grey text and cannot be selected by operators with a lower access level.)

Choosing this option will open up the {{waiting list}} record so that you can amend details as needed.

#### Duplicate record

If you need to add a new {{waiting list}} which is very similar to one you already have you can choose to duplicate the
existing one. The new {{waiting list}} will appear in the table with the same name as the original one, plus the word '
copy' at the end.

You should use the context menu again to edit this record, changing the name and any details which are different to your
existing group.  **Be aware that copying a {{waiting list}} includes the {{waiting list}} members. To remove them from
your new record, go to the '{{Waiting list}} members' tab and click on the red cross in the table to the right of anyone
who should not be there.**

#### View Mailchimp status

If you have the {{Comm}}s Module and are linked to Mailchimp it is possible to sync the members of the {{waiting list}}.
This means that you could send out a Mailchimp communication to all of them.
See [21.2.0 {{Comm}}s: Linking with Mailchimp](/help/index/p/21.2.0) for more details.

#### Print

If you select this option a new tab will open in your browser, and you will be given the option to print profile details
of those on the {{waiting list}}.  **Be careful** doing this with a large {{waiting list}} as the complete profile
information for each member of the {{waiting list}} will be downloaded.

#### Delete {{waiting list}}

You need to have an access level of Manager, System or Project Administrator to delete {{waiting list}}s.

If you choose to 'Delete {{waiting list}}' this is permanent and it is not possible to undo. It will delete the
{{waiting list}} and remove everyone that was on it, but it does not delete the profiles of members.

#### Communicate

If you have the {{Comm}}s Module enabled on your system, the context menu will also show a 'Communicate' option. When
selected this will open a new {{comm}}s record, with everyone currently on the {{waiting list}} (not including
historical members) automatically added to the recipients tab. See
section [10.1.0 Creating a {{Comm}}](/help/index//10.1.0) for more information on completing your {{comm}} record.

### My user restrictions

If the ['my user' restriction](/help/index/p/16.12.6) is enabled, operators affected will not be able to edit 
{{waiting list}}s directly.
