# 21.0.0 The Communications Module

> All Lamplight systems come with some communications capability. The communications module adds more functions and a tab in every profile to log the communications activity

The communications module lets you send and log communications:

- Email is sent through your own email servers, meaning you see the sent email in your ‘Sent’ email folder, and replies come directly to your email.
- You can send mail-merged and non-mail-merged letters, emails and mailing labels from any group/list, work record or profile in the system.
- You can use templates to set up standard mail-merged communications.
- You can buy SMS credits to send text messages directly from Lamplight.
- You can use {{Lamplight}} {{group}}s to create Mailchimp mailing lists.

There is more information on setting up email accounts in the core communications section (see XXXXXXXXXXXXX). Global communication settings, such as default reply-to address and automatically adding signatures to the bottom of emails, are also part of the core system - you can find more here XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
