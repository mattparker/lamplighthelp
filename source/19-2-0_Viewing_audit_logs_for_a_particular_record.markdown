# 19.2 Viewing audit logs for a particular record

> You can view the actions (view, edit etc) that have been carried out on particular records.

{{Activity}} records, profiles, and {{linked case}}s also have a link to view the audit logs for that record: this will show you every
time the record has been viewed, edited, or otherwise accessed (although it doesn’t include times when the record is
included in a listing of lots of records). These links are with the text that show a summary of when the record was
created and last edited.

In profiles, this is just below the address section of the contact details tab.

In {{activity}} records, this link is at the bottom of the ‘view full details’ screen.

In {{linked case}}s, the link is at the bottom of the details section.

Clicking this link (which is only displayed to system administrators) will take you direct to the audit logs view and
show you all log records relating to that record.  You can use the filters to further narrow down your search if needed.
