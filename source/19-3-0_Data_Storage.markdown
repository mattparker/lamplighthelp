# 19.3 Data Storage

> The audit module includes 5GB of log file storage, after which logs are archived and may be downloaded. You can 
> purchase additional storage if required.

The audit module stores up to 5GB of log data as standard – how far back this extends will depend on your usage level of
Lamplight.

This 5GB can be increased by purchasing additional ‘copies’ of the module, in the same way as the media module, which
increase the storage by 5GB each time. If you would like to increase your log file storage please contact the support
helpdesk to arrange this.

When the amount of log data exceeds 5GB, the oldest data will be archived to a text file and stored for up to 1 year.
You can download these text files and open them in Excel if you need to view or search these older logs.
