52.1.2 How to Create {{Workarea}}s and {{Subworkarea}}s

> If you start providing a new service, or the same service to a different group, chances are that you will need to add to your work or sub-workareas

You will see the {{workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s listed in the ‘when and where’ tab of your {{activity}} records. They let you keep track of what different types of {{work}} you are doing, and are important when it comes to reporting back on the work you have done.

You can add, edit and delete them in the same place, although both editing and deleting have implications for future reporting. (For more on this see [16.6.1 System Administration - Adding and Editing {{Workarea}}s](help/index/p/16.6.1).

Please note, the System Admnistration page has been updated since this video was made. The screen that is shown at 1 minute 40 no longer looks like this. You will now need to look for the {{Workarea}}s list in the 'Manage Custom Fields and Dropdown Lists' section, under the '{{Activity}} Records' heading.
