# 11.1.1    Adding {{outcome}}s - when and where

> Enter details of when the {{outcome}} was achieved/measured on the when and where tab. 

The date and {{workarea}} fields on the when and where tab are required. Many organisations will be able to simply ignore the time for the purposes of outcome records.

When selecting a {{workarea}}, you must select one {{workarea}}, and any number of {{subworkarea}}s. To add a {{workarea}}, click on the appropriate radio button / {{work area}}

You can add a {{subworkarea}} once you have selected a work area.  The {{subworkarea}}s for the {{workarea}} you have chosen will appear to the right hand side.  You simply select the {{subworkarea}} or {{subworkarea}}s you require.  Click on them a second time to deselect.

You can select as many locations as necessary or none, just select another option from the list. If one is selected in error, simply click again to deselect.
