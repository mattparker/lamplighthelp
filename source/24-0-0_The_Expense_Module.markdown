# 24.0.0 The Expense Module

> The Expense Module enables you to store and track costs associated with your work



This module will enable you to allocate the cost of staff and other resources so that you can calculate what your different services cost on a per-beneficiary basis.  It also provides a mechanism that allows you to manage staff expenses.

### Costing
You can track different types of cost:
- by {{workarea}} - do different types of service have different underlying cost basis?
- locations used - do different rooms (or resources) have different costs?
- staff (hourly and on-costs when linked with staff management module).
- direct petty cash type expenses incurred in delivering a {{work}} record.

### Expenses

The expenses functionality allows you to:
- link expense claims to specific {{work}}
- track and manage expenses to authorise the claim and payment status.
- report on your expenses.
- view and download total cost information.
- present cost data categorised by work completed.
