### Script

{{Outcome}}s are called several different things in Lamplight, and you may find that they have a different name in your system. 
You may add in scores through a button on a profile, or by adding them through your main menu.  

Whatever they are called in your system, adding and editing them in system administration will work in the same way. 

#### {{Outcome}}s in System Administration  

Previously when you opened the {{outcome}}s editing page in system administration it looked like this. You would see a list of existing categories, each one with its measures listed below it. You could reorder the list by dragging and dropping items into a new position. 
Now when you open the same page it will look like this. You can still see your {{outcome}} categories, and clicking on the name of each one will open a list of the measures which belong to it. 

#### Adding New Categories

To add a single new {{outcome}} category, click on the ‘add new {{outcome}} category’ button above the list. Here you can add the text of the category, for example ‘Health’. If you have a multi-{{project}} system you can also decide here which {{project}}s this new {{outcome}} category will be visible in. Click ‘update’ when you’ve added the details you need. 

You also have the option to enter them together. To do this, click on the ‘bulk odd {{outcome}} category’ button above the list, then enter their names into the text box, each one separated by a semi-colon. If you have a multi-{{project}} system and choose to add categories in bulk, you’ll need to go back to edit each one to show which {{project}}s the {{outcome}} is visible to. To do this, find the new category in the list then click on the pen and paper item to the right of it. Click ‘update’ when you have finished editing.
Although you can now see your new categories in the list, none of your changes will be finally saved until you click on ‘save all changes’ at the top or bottom of the page. 

#### Adding Measures to a Category  

Once you have added a new category, the next step is to add the measures to it. To do this, find the category in the list and click on it. You will see the option to ‘add new {{outcome}} measure.’ Clicking on this opens a box where you will fill in the name of the measure, what type it is – that could be a score, yes/no or number, minimum and maximum values and any notes that you want to add. We have a longer explanation of each of these things in our help pages. Once you have finished, click ‘update’.  

You also have the option to ‘bulk add {{outcome}} measures’. You can use this to add several measures at once. Just enter the name of each new measure separated by a semi-colon. If you choose to add them in this way you’ll then need to find each one in the list and edit it to include the type, values and notes, as we saw with the single measure before.  

#### Adding Descriptors

With {{outcome}}s you also have the option to add a description of the score to the values. Once you’ve done this, a database operator is adding the score to a measure will also see what that score represents.  

To do this, click on the ‘more’ button to the right of the measure. If you choose to add one new descriptor at a time, click on ‘add new score descriptor’, then put the score in the top box (for example 1), then the descriptor underneath (in this example very unhappy). Click update. 

To add more than one at a time, click the ‘bulk add score descriptor’ button then add the text for each one separated by a semi-colon. You don’t need to add the numbers with the text. It’s a good idea to do these in order (for example the descriptor for the score of one, followed by the descriptor for the score of 2 and so on). Click ‘add all’ when you have finished. The descriptors will be shown under the measure. You must now click the ‘edit’ button for each one and enter the score for it. After you have done this for the first one, Lamplight will predict the scores. You still need to check that each one is correct in the list. 

As with all changes in lists, they won’t be finally saved until you click on the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page.  

Database operators will now see these descriptors when adding {{outcome}} scores through the main menu, or the ‘add’ button on the right of the ‘{{outcome}}s’ profile tab. 

#### Editing Categories, Measures and Descriptors

Each category, measure and descriptor has a set of buttons to the right of it. If need to edit one of them just find it in the list and click on the pen and paper icon to the right. If it’s a measure or descriptor and you can’t immediately see it in the list, click on the name of the category or measure name to show the options underneath. Alternatively, you can click on the ‘show more’ three dots icon to the right of the category or measure.  

#### Changing the Order of Categories and Measures in the List  

You can move your {{outcome}} categories up and down the list, as well as reordering the measures in each category, or the descriptors in the measure. 
To do this, find the item that you would like to move. To the right you will see an up and down arrow. Click on these until you have the item where you need it to be.
Alternatively, above each list of categories, measures and descriptors there is a ‘sort’ button. If you click this once it will sort the items in alphabetical order. Click twice and it will reverse the order. 

#### Deleting Categories, Measures and Descriptors

There is a delete button to the right of each row. If you choose to delete a category it will then also remove any measures and descriptors in it. If you delete a measure then the descriptors below it will also be removed. Deleting a descriptor only eliminates that single item. 

There are consequences to removing any {{outcome}} measure. To understand these in detail, please see section 16.6.2 of our help pages. 
When you choose to ‘delete’ an item it will turn red in the list. If you did this by mistake then press the ‘delete’ button again to return it to normal. The item will not be permanently deleted until you press the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page. Once you have done this then you can’t restore the item to the list.  

When you’ve made all the changes that you need, remember to click the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page before leaving. If you don’t do this then all your changes will be lost.  

If you need to know more details, you can find them in section 16.6.2 of our help pages. 

Thank you for watching.
