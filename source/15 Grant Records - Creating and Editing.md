# {{Grant}} records in Lamplight allow you to record money/items coming in to your {{org}} or being going to a {{user}}.


You can keep records of money or items coming in to your {{org}} or being allocated to your {{user}}s by using {{grant}} records. If you canâ€™t see them in your system, it is possible for a System Administrator to turn them on in global settings
![15 {{Grant}} Records - Creating and Editing - step 1](15_Grant_Records_-_Creating_and_Editing_im_1.png)

These records can be used in a number of different ways:
For {{grant}}s and donations coming in to the {{org}}
To keep track of payments in kind
To show donations and {{grant}}s given to {{user}}s - money for shoes, phone cards, for example
To track benefits that a {{user}} may be receiving
To track emergency funds allocated to {{user}}s

The following pages will explain how to create and edit {{grant}} records
