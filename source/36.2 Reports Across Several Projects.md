# 36.2 Reports Across Several Projects

If you have access to more than one {{project}} (for more on Lamplight {{project}}s see section [17 {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/17))) you will also see a Select {{project}}s to Include&#039; drop down when running your report

1. Click on Select {{project}}s to includeâ€¦

2. Simply tick the boxes for the {{project}}s you want to include, and Lamplight will combine the results from these into a single {{report}}.
- Note that if you used {{group}} or {{work}} area filters in the previous tab (see link to new {{Report}} Filter page) you need to be sure that these {{group}}s or {{work}} areas are shared across all {{project}}s.
- So for example if you report with all {{workarea}}s blank, then it will report on {{workarea}}s across all projects. If you report on a {{workarea}} which is only in project 1, then you won't see results from projects 2 or 3, as there will be no matching results to show.
