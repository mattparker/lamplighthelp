# 13.1.0 Creating {{Group}} Data Views

> You can set up as many {{group}} data views as you need in {{Lamplight}}, and each one can be used with any {{group}}. Like {{group}}s, the ones that you create will show in the {{group}} data views table for any database operator on your system to use



To add a new {{group}} data view:

- On the main menu, go to '{{group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> add'.
- The first screen will look like this:

-  There are a number of tabs. Some of the ones you see (for example Evalusations and Communications) will depend on the modules that you have on your system. 
- Apart from the 'View name' tab, you only need to edit the ones which contain information that you want to include in your data view. 
  - View name. This is the only tab that you must complete - both the name and description are required fields. When you view the table of data views in the future the name is what you will see, so try and choose something that will remind you and other people what it's for. 
  - Contact details. You can select which contact information you'd like to see. Please note that if you use this {{group}} data view to view a {{group}}, the {{person}}/{{org}}'s name will already appear by default so you won't need to include it in the data view.
  - {{User}} fields, {{Staff}} fields, {{Funder}} fields and {{Contact}} fields. The information in these tabs relates to the fields in the profile tabs of your {{people}}/{{org}}s. The options within these pages will be unique to your system.
- Relationships. You can show information in your data view about named individuals/{{org}}s that members of the {{group}} are linked to. Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see the 'name only' of the linked profile, or 'name and contact details'.
  - {{Work}} and {{Outcome}}s tabs. The 'General summary figures' section at the top of this page lets you select general information (for example number of records in the last month). Further down, the 'Detailed summary figures' section allows you to be more specific about the information you see in your data view. You will need to fill in the 'Detailed {{work}} data' to show what information you want about the records, as well as the date range of the data you want to see. There are other filters, such as {{workarea}} and location, which you can use to filter the records shown.

The example above asks for the number of attendances between 20th February 2019 and 20th May 2019 split by {{workarea}}. If you view a {{group}} using this data view, the result will be a table which has a column for each {{workarea}} showing the number of attendances in it.

**{{Referral}}s, {{Comm}}s, {{Eval}}s, {{Grant}}s, {{Linked case}}s tabs:** each of these lets you add summary details about {{referral}}s, {{comm}}s, {{eval}}s, {{grant}}s and {{linked case}}s. Where these relate to a module, you will only see the tab if you have that module switched on in your system. 

**Project sharing:** allows you to share the {{group}} data view with other projects. You will need a multi-project set-up and to have access to other projects to see this option.

**Blank column(s):** means that you can add blank columns to your {{group}} data views. You will need a title for each column. This can be useful if you are using {{group}} data views for a sign-in sheet, and you need a 'signature' column, for example. If you wish to add more than one custom column, separate them by using a semi-colon (;) but no space.

When you have added all the information you wish to see, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right of any page.
