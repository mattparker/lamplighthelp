# 13.1.0 <i class="fas fa-binoculars"></i> Creating {{Group}} Data Views

> You can set up as many {{group}} data views as you need in {{Lamplight}}, and each one can be used with any {{group}}. Like {{group}}s, the ones that you create will show in the {{group}} data views table for any database operator on your system to use



To add a new {{group}} data view:

- On the main menu, go to '{{group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> add'.
- The first screen will look like this:

![Adding a {{group}} data view](111a.png)

There are several tabs. Some of the ones you see (for example Evaluations and Communications) will depend on the modules
that you have on your system. Apart from the 'View name' tab, you only need to edit the ones which contain information
that you want to include in your data view.

- View name. This is the only tab that you must complete - both the name and description are required fields. When you
  view the table of data views in the future the name is what you will see, so try and choose something that will remind
  you and other people what it's for.
- Contact details. You can select which contact information you'd like to see. Please note that if you use this
  {{group}} data view to view a {{group}}, the {{person}}/{{org}}'s name will already appear by default so you won't
  need to include it in the data view.
- {{User}} fields, {{Staff}} fields, {{Funder}} fields and {{Contact}} fields. The information in these tabs relates to
  the fields in the profile tabs of your {{people}}/{{org}}s. The options within these pages will be unique to your
  system.
- Relationships. You can show information in your data view about named individuals/{{org}}s that members of the
  {{group}} are linked to. Click to select the relationship type you wish to use, and whether you want to see the 'name
  only' of the linked profile, or 'name and contact details'. If you select 'name and contact details for download' you
  will get the same information as 'name and contact details' but each field is separated by a pipe symbol - | - and
  empty fields are included. This means that if you download the data and do 'text to columns' you'll be able to get the
  data nicely. However it doesn't look so nice on screen if you just want to see the information in {{Lamplight}}.
- {{Work}}, {{Referral}}, {{Grant}} and {{Outcome}}s tabs. The 'General summary figures' section at the top of this page lets you select
  general information (for example number of records in the last month). Further down, the 'Detailed summary
  figures' section allows you to be more specific about the information you see in your data view. You will need to
  fill in the 'Detailed {{work}} data' to show what information you want about the records, as well as the date
  range of the data you want to see. There are other filters, such as {{workarea}} and location, which you can use
  to filter the records shown.

The example above asks for the number of attendances between 20th February 2019 and 20th May 2019 split by {{workarea}}.
If you view a {{group}} using this data view, the result will be a table which has a column for each {{workarea}}
showing the number of attendances in it.

**{{Comm}}s, {{Eval}}s, {{Linked case}}s tabs:** each of these lets you add summary details
about {{referral}}s, {{comm}}s, {{eval}}s, {{grant}}s and {{linked case}}s. Where these relate to a module, you will
only see the tab if you have that module switched on in your system.


**Project sharing:** allows you to share the {{group}} data view with other projects. You will need a multi-project
set-up and to have access to other projects to see this option.

**Blank column(s):** means that you can add blank columns to your {{group}} data views. You will need a title for each
column. This can be useful if you are using {{group}} data views for a sign-in sheet, and you need a 'signature' column,
for example. If you wish to add more than one custom column, separate them by using a semi-colon (;) but no space.

When you have added all the information you wish to see, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right of any page.
