# 17.2.1 {{Project}} Sharing - Setting Up {{Activity}} Sharing Policies

> The System Administrator will need to set up {{activity}} sharing policies that determine what information is shared between {{project}}s. 

If you have more than one project in Lamplight, you may want to share some of the custom tabs and fields between projects. Policies allow you to control what types of {{activity}} are shared.

- Click ‘admin’ in the main menu’.
- Select ‘system administration’ from the sub-menu below.
- In the ‘Manage projects’ section, click ‘Project sharing work etc policies’.
- As with other lists in Lamplight you'll see current policies.

- Double-click the 'double click to add' label at the bottom of the list and name the new policy. This is what will appear in the drop-down lists that database operators see, so make sure the names are clear. When you have done that, press 'Enter' on your keyboard to save the policy name.
- Click 'add policy details’ below the policy name. A popup window will appear:

 - Set the various options that define this policy:
   - what can database operators in other projects do with the data you're sharing: view only, view and edit or view, edit and delete.
   - to which database operator role the rights you’re setting up relate.
   - which project(s) are included in this policy (to select more than on, hold down ctrl on your keyboard in Windows, or cmd on a Mac).
   - to include all projects in the policy, choose ‘make policy available for use in all projects’.
- Click 'Save'. 

This policy is now available for use.

**Please note:** If you edit an existing policy, all records previously shared using that policy will be updated. For example, if you change the projects that a policy applies to, all old records that you have shared will reflect the changes that you have made. If you do not want this, you can delete the policy and create a new one.
