# 8.2.0  <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Viewing {{Outcome}}s Records for a Particular Person: The {{Outcome}}s Tab

> The '{{Outcome}}s' tab in a {{person}}'s profile is where you can see the change they've experienced over time




{{Outcome}}s scores already recorded for the individual or organisation are displayed on this tab. There are three different ways to show the information: a radar chart, in an advanced table, and in a normal table view. You can choose which of these you see by changing your Personal Settings (for more on this, go to [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2)).

The information you see on the '{{Outcome}}s' tab in a profile will only be for the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile you are viewing.

### The Radar Chart

![The Radar Chart](8.2.0a.png)

The radar chart shows the score for a single {{outcome}} measure on each axis. You can choose the {{outcome}} category you want to look at from the drop-down box directly above the chart. 

If scores have been entered for these {{outcome}}s, they will show on the chart. The position of the line shows the scores, and colour of the line matches to a box to the right of the chart, showing the date the score was added.

For example, the picture above shows the results in November (brown, inner line); February (pink line) and July (blue line). 'I've been feeling relaxed' has gone from a score of 3 in November (meaning they are not very relaxed) to a 5 in July (meaning their feeling of relaxation has increased). In general (assuming larger numbers are better) you will hope that the shapes made by the lines on the chart get gradually bigger as time goes on.

### The Advanced Table 

![The Advanced Table](8.2.0b.png)

The advanced table lists each individual {{outcome}} measure down the left. The columns along the top show any months in which {{outcome}} scores have been recorded. 

You can click a single cell, or existing score, to add or edit an {{outcome}}. 

![Editing a Cell in the Advanced Table](8.2.0c.png)

The 'difference' column shows the difference in results between the first time that they were recorded and the last. For example, the top {{outcome}} in the table above shows an initial score for the measure 'I have been feeling optimistic about the future' of 3. The last time the score was recorded it was a 5. This means that the score has gone up two points (+2).

The 'Add' column on the right lets you add a new {{outcome}} score (for more on this, see [8.1.6 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Advanced Table](/help/index/p/8.1.6)).

### The Normal Table

![{{Outcome}}s - The Normal Table](8.2.0d.png)

The table view at the bottom is for viewing the {{outcome}}s data that has been entered. It shows a record for each time that an {{outcome}}s measure has been scored. 

The 'Summary' column shows the measure and score for each record. 

You can customise your table in the following ways:

- Click on the top row of a column to re-order the records. For example, you could choose to sort by date, category or {{workarea}}. 

- View more or fewer records on one page by choosing an option from the 'Show' drop-down above the table. Alternatively, you can click on the page numbers (also above the table) to move through the records.

- Change the columns that you see in the table by right-clicking on the top header-row to see a list of what is available.

![{{Outcome}}s - The Normal Table Menu](8.2.0e.png)

- Simply tick and untick columns in the list to customise what you see in the table. If you want to keep these as the default settings for this table, choose 'Save table columns layout' from the menu.

### The Context Menu
Right clicking on a row of the {{outcome}} table will give you a range of options:

![{{Outcome}}s tab on a profile - context menu](50b.png)

#### View full details
This opens the {{outcome}} record on one page so that you can view the details.
#### Edit
This will open the data entry window where you can edit the details of the {{outcome}}. (See section [8.1.0 Adding {{Outcome}}s](/help/index/p/8.1.0)).
#### Delete
Use this option to remove the {{outcome}} from the system. It will still be possible to find it in the {{outcome}}s table (for more on this see [8.3.0 Viewing All {{Outcome}s Records](/help/index/p/8.3.0), but it will not show in reports or data views.

If you use {{linked case}}s in your system, there more options (See section [9.0.0 {{Linked case}}s](/help/index/p/9.0.0) for more on {{linked case}}s):

#### Link to {{linked case}}
You can add this {{outcome}} to a {{linked case}}. 
#### Remove link to {{linked case}}
If this record is already attached to a {{linked case}} you can remove it here.
#### Close {{linked case}}**
This will flag the {{linked case}} as closed.
#### Re open {{linked case}}
It is not possible to attach new records to a closed {{linked case}}. You can use this option to open it if it has previously been closed. 
#### View {{linked case}} details
This takes you to a screen to see the details of the {{linked case}}.
#### Edit {{linked case}}
Choosing this option allows you to edit the details of the {{linked case}} itself.

If you have the {{Comm}}s Module you will also see:

#### Communicate
You can open a new {{comm}}s record with the recipients already added to match the attendees of the {{outcome}} record.
