 You can:

  * enter in your 'signature' - the text that is added automatically to the bottom of {{comm}}s. 
  * decide what tabs appear on your homepage. These can also be re-arranged by click, holding and dragging the boxes into the order you wish them to appear. 
  * choose which {{project}} would be the one you first arrive to when you log in (if you have a multi-{{project}} system)
  * decide if you wish to use a {{group}} data view as a summary tab. For more information please see section [14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.1) 
  * change the database colour scheme 
  * show or hide menu options
  * choose your preferred view of {{outcome}}s data on the {{outcome}} profile tab
  * decide the most suitable minute precision used in records - do you need to-the-minute accuracy, or will 15 minutes do?

Once changes have been made, click 'Save' in the bottom right hand corner. To fully refresh and update the system of your changes, click F5 on you keyboard.
