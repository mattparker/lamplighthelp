# 30.2.0    {{Waiting List}}} Module: Managing {{Waiting List}}s from the Menu Bar

> Once you have {{waiting lists}} on your system, it's possible to manage them from the menu bar

### Finding a {{Waiting List}}

- To view all {{waiting list}}s, on the main menu go to {{work}} -> view -> {{waiting list}}s. 
- A table will display all the {{waiting list}}s that have been created, and their status.

 - With this table, as with others in {{Lamplight}}, if you have a number of {{waiting list}}s shown in the table you can show more rows in the table and if you have multiple pages you can change the page number. You can also sort the table by clicking on the column header.

### The {{Waiting List}} Menu

- You can open the {{waiting list}} context menu by clicking on the button to the left of it, or right-clicking on the relevant table row.

- There are a number of different options on this menu:

   **View Full Details**

   - This shows you each {{person}} currently on the {{waiting list}}, the date they joined and the length of time they have been on it. If there is a black arrow to the right of this row, there are {{group}} data views which you can use to see more detail about people on the {{waiting list}}. See section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/p/14.8.0) for more information.

   **Quick View in Pop-up
   
   - This allows you to view the current members of the {{waiting list}} in a pop-up box. From here you can choose to download the data into a spreadsheet or print it as a table if you want to.
   
   **Historical View in Pop-up**
   
   - You can use this option view an historical view which shows the details of all {{people}} and {{org}}s who have been on the list, past and present. Again this table can be downloaded or printed if required.
   
   **Edit**

   - Database operators with a Manager level of access or above will be given the option to edit the {{waiting list}} (this option is visible in grey text and cannot be selected by operators with a lower access level.) Choosing this option will open up the {{waiting list}} record so that you can amend details as needed. 
   
   **Duplicate record**
   
   - If you need to add a new {{waiting list}} which is very similar to an existing one, you can choose to duplicate the exising one. The new {{waiting list}} will appear in the table with the same name as the initial one, plus the word 'copy' at the end. 
   - You should use the context menu again to open this record and change the name and any details which are different to your existing group. 
   - Be aware, copying a {{waiting list}} includes the {{waiting list}} members. To remove them from your new record, go to the 'Waiting list members' tab and click on the red cross in the table to the right of anyone who should not be there. 
   
   **Print**
   
   - If you select this option a new tab will open in your browser, and you will be given the option to print information from the profiles of those on the {{waiting list}}.
   
   **Delete group**
   
   - You need to have an access level of Manager, System or Project Administrator to delete {{waiting list}}s. If you choose to 'Delete {{group}}' this is permanent and it is not possible to undo.



   **View Mailchimp Status**
   
   - If you have the {{Comm}}s Module and your {{Lamplight}} is linked to Mailchimp, it is possible to communicate with people on the {{waiting list}} through Mailchimp. See XXXXXXXXXXXX.
   
   **Communicate**
   
   - If you have the {{Comm}}s Module enabled on your system, the context menu will also show a '{{comm}}' option. When selected this will open a new {{comm}}s record, with everyone currently on the {{waiting list}} (not including historical members) automatically added to the recipients tab. See section [12.0.0  {{Comm}}s](/help/index//12.0.0) for more information on completing your {{comm}} record.
