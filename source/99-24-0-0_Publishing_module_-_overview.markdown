# 24.0.0    Publishing module - overview

> The publishing module allows you to connect {{Lamplight}} with the wider world. 

You may want to advertise your forthcoming training courses on your website or via social media, or create a directory of {{staff}} contacts or local agencies. The publishing module takes the information already entered into your {{Lamplight}} system and publishes it to your website or elsewhere. There is no need to duplicate information, and you have peace of mind that your site is as accurate and as up-to-date as your database.

Doing this will require you to set up your website to securely access the information in {{Lamplight}} and display it as you want it. We have an entire website, found at [www.lamplight- publishing.co.uk](http://www.lamplight-publishing.co.uk) that provides a fully documented API, working examples, and code downloads.
