# 22.0.0 The {{Eval}}s Module

> The {{Eval}}s Module gives you the ability to create custom surveys, feedback forms and questionnaires, and to report back on your findings



Evaluation forms are a common way of getting a snapshot view of things are going with your {{user}}s and with your services. {{Lamplight}} can help you record and analyse that information in an intutitive and flexible way. You can set up as many surveys as you need with different types of questions in them. You can then analyse the results in various ways. 

For more detail, see:
- [22.1.0 Setting Up {{Eval}}s](/help/index/p/22.1.0).
- [22.1.1 Editing and Deleting {{Eval}}s](/help/index/p/22.1.1).
- [22.2.0 Adding and Editing {{Eval}} Reponses](/help/index/p/22.2.0).
- [22.3.0 Viewing {{Eval}} Data Entered](/help/index/p/22.3.0).
- [14.2.0 {{Eval}} Report](/help/index/p/14.2.0).

You may also want to add the evaluations direct module that lets participants fill in their responses online, saving you time and paper.

If you need to report on one-off data, {{Eval}}s can be used as another way of tracking impact on your {{user}}s. See section [8.0.0  {{Outcome}}s](/help/index/p/8.0.0) for a discussion of the difference between {{outcome}}s and {{eval}}s in {{Lamplight}}.
