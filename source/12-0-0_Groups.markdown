> {{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of {{people}} or {{org}}s. You can create different types of {{group}}: {{auto group}}s, {{manual group}}s or {{merge group}}s. You can use information from profiles or activity records to filter your {{group}} members



### What is a {{Group}}?

A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}} or {{org}}s. You can set up any number of {{group}}s in your system, and each {{person}} in your database can belong to any number of {{group}}s. For example, you may set up the following {{group}}s:

 - Steering group members.
 - Female {{User}}s in N1 aged over 20.
 - New {{user}}s in Q2 and Q3 2019.
 - All youth work staff.
 - Organisations working with children.
 
They are shared across database operators, so that if you set up a {{group}} another database operator with access to your system will be able to use it too.

### Types of {{Group}}

There are three types of {{group}}: {{manual group}}s, {{auto group}}s, and {{merge group}}s. 
- {{Manual group}}s are created by selecting the individual {{people}} or {{org}}s that you want to include. Similar to a written list of names, the {{group}} won't change unless someone manually updates the list.
- {{Auto group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. 'postcode starts with N1') and {{Lamplight}} searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}}, {{Lamplight}} will automatically check again. For example, if someone moves out of the area and you update their postcode, that person will not appear in the {{group}} when it is next run. 
- {{Merge group}}s are created by joining existing {{group}}s together. {{Lamplight}} will combine all the members of each {{group}} and combine them into one. 

### Using {{Group}}s

You can use {{group}}s in different ways:

- Bulk data entry. If you have a regular {{group}} of {{user}}s that comes to a particular session every week, instead of adding them individually each time you can create a {{group}}. All you need to do then is type the name of the {{group}} into the search box on the 'Attendance' tab of your {{work}} record. {{Lamplight}} will automatically add everyone that's in the {{group}} to the attendance table in the {{work}} record (see section [7.1.2 Adding Attendance Details](/help/index//p/7.1.2)). You can do the same for {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s records.
- {{Report}} filters. {{Group}}s can be used to filter whose data is included in a {{report}} (see section [14.1.1 {{Report}} filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1)). This will provide a report on a specific set of people. 
- {{Group}} data views. You can use data views to show detailed information about members of the {{group}} (see section [13 {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/13)).
