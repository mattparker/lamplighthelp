### To Change Your Password Through System Admin
- Go to 'admin -> change password' on the main menu. 

For security reasons you will need to enter your current username (email address) and password, and your new password.

If your organisation has set up its own policy on what combination of letters, numbers and symbols passwords must contain, you will see this below the password-changing boxes. If this is not the case, passwords need to be between 8 and 20 characters long and consist of letters and numbers. 

Save the new password once you've finished.  You will receive on-screen confirmation that your password has been changed.

### To Change Your Password on the Login Page

If you have forgotten your current password, you can request a new one from the 'Forgotten your password?' link on the login page.

Follow the instructions and a new password will be sent to the email address that you use to log in to your account. 

Log in again using the new password. If you are cutting and pasting it from an email, make sure not to copy any spaces either side of the password, as these will cause your login to fail. 

On the next screen you will be prompted to change to a new password. If your organisation has a password policy, that will be shown at the bottom of the screen. If there is no policy, then your password will need to be between 6 and 20 characters long and consist of letters and numbers.
