# 41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies

> Charging and payee policies are used when you create {{work}} records.


To add charging and payee policies to {{work}} records:

1. Create a new {{work}} record and fill it out as you normally would (for more information on how to do this 
see [7 Work Records - Adding New](/help/index/p/7))

2. Go to the 'Charges' tab

3. You will see two dropdowns: 

    - 'select charging policy for this record' 
    - 'select payee policy for this record'

4. If the dropdowns are empty you will need to create some policies (for more information on this see 
[125.2 {{Charging}} Module: Setting Up Rules and Policies](/help/index/p/125.2)

*** UP TO HERE *** - ASK HANNAH WHY IT'S REFERRED OT AS CHARGES MODULE IN OLD HELP AND S/S AS CALLED CHARGING MODULE IN SYSTEM

- If you can see policies, select the ones you wish to use for this {{work}} record from the dropdowns. 
- When you save the record {{Lamplight}} will calculate charges for each person listed on the attendance tab, and then determine who will pay them. 
- When you save the record you will see this information in summary in the attendance table: 

![Viewing charges and payees in a {{work}} record](20.6.0b.png)

Because the 'other payees' may be any number of {{people}}, they are combined into one column for this view. See section [20.6.1 Viewing payments due from a particular {{person}}](/help/index/p/20.6.1) for help on seeing how charges are allocated. 

If you later edit or delete this record, the charges and payees may also change. If the payments due change, {{Lamplight}} will either update them, or create a credit if the charge has already been invoiced (see section [20.6.2 Creating invoices in bulk](/help/index/p/20.6.2)).
