# 41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies

> Charging and payee policies are used when you create {{work}} records.


To add charging and payee policies to {{work}} records:

1. Create a new {{work}} record and fill it out as you normally would (for more information on how to do this 
see [7 Work Records - Adding New](/help/index/p/7))

2. Go to the 'Charges' tab
![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 1](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_1.png)

3. You will see two dropdowns: 

    - 'select charging policy for this record'
    ![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 2](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_2.png)

    - 'select payee policy for this record'
    ![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 3](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_3.png)

4. If the dropdowns are empty you will need to create some policies (for more information on this see 
[125.2 {{Charging}} Module: Setting Up Rules and Policies](/help/index/p/125.2)

5. If you can see policies select the ones you wish to use for this {{work}} record from the dropdowns
![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 4](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_4.png)
![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 5](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_5.png)

6. When you save the record {{Lamplight}} will calculate charges for each person listed on the attendance tab and then 
determine who will pay them

7. You can view this information in summary in the attendance table in the following colunms,

    - 'Charge'
    ![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 6](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_6.png)

    - 'Payments due from attendee'
    ![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 7](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_7.png)

    - 'Payments due from others'
    ![41.1 {{Charging}} Module: Using Charging and Payee Policies - step 8](41.1_Charging_Module-_Using_Charging_and_Payee_Policies_im_8.png)


Note because the 'Payments due from others' may be any number of {{profile}}s they are combined into one column for this view. For
more on this see section [41.2 {{Charging}} Module: Viewing payments due](/help/index/p/41.2).

If you later edit or delete this record the charges and payees may also change. If the payments due change {{Lamplight}} will 
either update them or create a credit if the charge has already been invoiced (see section [41.3 {{Charging}} Module: Creating 
invoices](/help/index/p/20.6.2)).
