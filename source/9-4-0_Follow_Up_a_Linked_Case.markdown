# 9.4.0  <i class="fas fa-link"></i> Follow Up a {{Linked Case}}

> If you already have a {{linked case}} with records in, you can use one of those as the basis for another record in the same {{linked case}}



If need to add {{activity}} records ({{work}}, {{referral}}, {{outcome}} etc) to a {{linked case}} which already holds a similar record to the one you need to add, it is possible to duplicate one of the existing records. This will retain all the details of the original (date and time, {{workarea}}, attendees, text notes etc.).  It will open automatically so that you can edit the details rather than needing to add all the information in from scratch.

To do this:

- Go to the '{{Linked case}} view' tab in a profile, and click on the {{linked case}} you need to add the record to.
- In the table of records at the bottom of the screen, find the one that you are going to duplicate and either right-click on the table row, or left click on the context menu in the first table column. 
- From the menu, choose 'Follow up {{linked case}}'. This will open up as a new record for you to edit.

When you have finished changing the details, click 'Save' and it will be saved into the {{linked case}}.

**Please note:** If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is closed, you cannot follow it up and the option will be disabled (appearing as greyed-out text in the menu).
