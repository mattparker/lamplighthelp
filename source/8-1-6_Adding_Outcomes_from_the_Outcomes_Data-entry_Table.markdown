# 8.1.6 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Data-entry Table

> You can add {{outcome}}s to a person's profile by entering them into the data table in their '{{Outcome}}s' tab

If you have the 'advanced table' enabled in the '{{Outcome}}s' tab then you can enter new scores for measures in the last column. If you can't see this table then you will need to enable it in your personal settings. For more on this see [16.4.2 Personal Settings: Profiles](/help/index/p/16.4.2). There is also a 'normal' table where you can view data, but which does not have a column for adding scores. For more on these two tables see [8.0.0 {{Outcome}}s](/help/index/p/8.0.0).

To add data in the advanced table:

- Scroll down to find the measures in the table that you would like to add scores for.
- Enter the scores for as many measures as you need into the final column.
- Scroll to the bottom of the table and enter the date and {{workarea}}.
