# 27 {{Group}}s and Data Views - Finding the information You Want About Specific {{People}}

### {{Group}}s
{{Group}}s in Lamplight are collections of profiles or {{org}}s. You can use information from profiles or {{activity}} records to filter your {{group}} members.
You can set up any number of {{group}}s in your system, and each {{person}} in your database can belong to any number of {{group}}s. 
{{Group}}s answer the question ‘Who is/has …’ E.g.
{{Volunteer}}s
Female users aged over 25
New users in Q2 and Q3 2024

### Data Views
Data views are a way of selecting specific pieces of information you want to view about profiles.
For example, once you have created a {{group}} you may want to be able to view the date each member last attended a session, and their contact details. You can create a {{group}} data view to pull that information from the records in Lamplight and then show it in table columns next to the names in your {{group}}.
Data views do not filter the profiles in your {{group}}s: they simply add details to these {{group}}s.

1. Click on {{Group}}s from the main Menu to access all current {{group}}s and data views in your system

2. There are three types of {{group}}: {{manual group}}s, {{auto group}}s, and {{merge group}}s.
- {{Manual group}}s are created by selecting the individual profiles or {{org}}s that you want to include. Similar to a written {{group}} of names, the {{group}} won&#039;t change unless someone manually updates (adds or removes profiles) the {{group}}.
- {{Auto group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. &#039;{{postcode}} starts with N1&#039;) and {{Lamplight}} searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}}, {{Lamplight}} will automatically check again. For example, if someone moves out of the area and you update their {{postcode}}, that {{person}} will not appear in the {{group}} when it is next run.
- {{Merge group}}s are created by joining existing {{group}}s together. Lamplight will combine all the members of each {{group}} and combine them into one.

3. A {{Group}} Without a Data View

4. The Same {{Group}} with a Data View

### Using {{Group}}s
You can use {{group}}s in different ways:
- Bulk data entry. If you have a regular {{group}} of {{user}}s that comes to a particular session every week, instead of adding them individually each time you can create a {{group}}. All you need to do then is type the name of the {{group}} into the search box on the 'Attendance' tab of your {{work}} record. {{Lamplight}} will automatically add everyone that's in the {{group}} to the attendance table in the {{work}} record (see section [7.1 Adding Work Record Details](/help/index/p/7.1)). You can do the same for {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s records.
- {{Report}} filters. {{Group}}s can be used to filter whose data is included in a {{report}} (see section [36 Report Filters](/help/index/p/36)). This will provide a {{report}} on a specific set of profiles.
- {{Group}} data views. You can use data views to show detailed information about members of the {{group}} (see section [27 Lists and Data Views - Finding the information You Want About Specific People](/help/index/p/27)).

### Using Data Views
It is best not to create data views with too much in them. If you are asking for a lot of information it will need a large table with multiple columns which would be difficult to view. It takes longer for Lamplight to process and show the data. It is better to create a number of smaller data views for different purposes.

To use the data views you have created, see section [33 Data Views - Different Ways To Use them](https://new.lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/33).
