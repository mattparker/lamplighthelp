# 52.2 Acting on a {{Safeguarding case}}

> When a {{safeguarding case}} is raised it should be acted on promptly by a {{safeguarding lead contact}}.

Lamplight expects that when a {{safeguarding case}} is raised a {{Safeguarding}} Manager will review the {{safeguarding case}} and then assign it
to one or more {{safeguarding lead contact}}s. The {{safeguarding lead contact}}s will have full access to the {{safeguarding case}} and be able 
to update it as it proceeds. {{Safeguarding}} Managers will continue to have access for oversight purposes.

The person that raised the {{safeguarding concern}} may be automatically assigned as a {{safeguarding lead contact}}. The
{{Safeguarding}} Manager may want to change this or add others on reviewing it. Automatic assignment is set as a global configuration
setting (see [138 Safeguarding Module Setup](/help/index/p/138)).

Until {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned the actions that may be carried out are limited. In many cases the first 
action will be to assign an {{safeguarding lead contact}}. {{Safeguarding}} managers may also assign an initial severity rating
or make an initial comment for the {{safeguarding lead contact}}s based on the preliminary information provided.

Once {{safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned they will take the matter forward, adding details as they go so that there
is a single, ongoing and up-to-date record of the actions they have carried out.

So, when a {{Safeguarding}} Manager recieves a notification their first task will be to review the {{safeguarding case}} 
and assign or check the {{safeguarding lead contact}}, for more information see [52.2.2 Assigning Lead Contacts](/help/index/p/52.2.2). You can click the link in the notification email to jump straight to the
{{safeguarding case}} but new {{safeguarding case}}s are also listed on the dedicated home page tab (see [52.5 Safeguarding Dashboard](/help/index/p/52.5) and the [52.2.1 Viewing all Safeguarding Cases](/help/index/p/52.2.1).
