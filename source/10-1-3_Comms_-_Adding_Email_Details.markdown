# 10.1.3    {{Comm}}s - Adding Email Details

> Filling out the email details tab

If you are sending emails, you will need to complete the email details tab.  Email systems often require the reply-to address to match the sender address, and may not send the email at all if they don't. If you are not sure about this you'll need to check with your system administrator or email provider.

Emails are sent through your own email system and will appear in your outbox.  Replies will be sent to your own email.

You can give the email a subject title in the text box.

You can also choose how to send out your email.

1. A separate personalised email.  This will send an email in which you can mail merge the names of the recipients and other identifying information into the email.  We strongly recommend you only use this for emails with a smaller number of participants, or without attachments.

2. A single email copied (cc) to all recipients.  This will send the same email to everyone.  Using the C.C. (Carbon copy) option means that all the recipients will see the email addresses of the other recipients.  This is often not appropriate for mailings outside of your immediate organisation.  You can still mail-merge information that will go to everyone.

3. A single email blind copied (bcc) to all recipients.  This is the option to use if you do not wish email recipients to see who else has received the email, and their email address.  This is standard practice for mailings and email to groups of people who will not have this information already. 

If you are sending to a large number of recipients, and particularly if there are attachments, we strongly recommend that you send a single email, especially if your email provider has limits on the number of emails sent out daily.
