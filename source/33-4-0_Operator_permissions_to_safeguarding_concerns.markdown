# 33.4.0 Operator permissions to {{safeguarding case}}s

> Access to full details about a {{safeguarding case}} is only available to {{Safeguarding}} Managers or {{Safeguarding lead contact}}s. Others see
> limited data.

Safeguarding Managers can see full information and make any changes to all {{safeguarding case}}s. We would generally recommend that a
manager assign themselves as an {{safeguarding lead contact}} if they are going to investigate the {{safeguarding case}}.

{{Safeguarding lead contact}}s are assigned to particular {{safeguarding case}}. A {{safeguarding lead contact}} may be any database operator. A {{Safeguarding lead contact}} of a
{{safeguarding case}} can see full information and make any changes to that {{safeguarding case}}.

Other staff can see a very limited summary of all {{safeguarding case}}s. They will be able to see:

 - The dates 
 - The status
 - Any shared text added to the {{safeguarding case}} by a {{Safeguarding lead contact}}, and the subject of the {{safeguarding case}}. 


This information is available through the main menu {{activity}} > {{safeguarding}} > view {{safeguarding case}}s. It is also shown within
profiles, just below their name.

Other staff are not able to make any changes or add any information to {{safeguarding case}}s.
