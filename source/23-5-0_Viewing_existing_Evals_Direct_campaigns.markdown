# 23.5.0    Working with Existing {{Eval}}s Direct Campaigns

> To view a existing {{Eval}} Direct campaigns, go to {{work}} > DataDirect > {{eval}} campaigns > view on the main menu. 

The table here shows you a list of all the campaigns open during the dates you have specified in personal settings, and some basic information, including the number of invitees and the number of respondents.  

You can use the 'Search' bar durectly above the table to filter the records you see by date, work area, custom fields, and to add additional columns.  See the 'filter' section below.

### The Context Menu

Using the context menu (small square on the left of each row), you also have a number of options.

- View Full details: Shows a summary of the campaign information and settings.
- Edit: Edits the campaign information and settings.
   - You'll see that some items are blanked out: to prevent data inconsistencies you cannot change the {{eval}} template, {{workarea}}, or the separate page option.

   - In addition, for 'separate page' campaigns, you cannot remove invitees that have already responded: the red cross to delete will not be visible in the invitees table. 
   - When you have made the changes you want to, click the 'save' button.
- Delete: Deletes the campaign.  You cannot undo this.
   - You can only delete campaigns that have not had any responses. If you try and delete one that has already had some you will receive an error message. 
   - If you do want to stop an existing campaign, you can edit it and change the 'date to' to the current time and date, which will prevent any more responses. Anyone attempting to respond to it will see an error {{message}}. 
- Duplicate record: Duplicates the campaign, so that you can alter it, rather then creating afresh.
- Email all invitees/have responded/not yet reponded: Takes you to a communication page to email these invitees. [(Sending a communication)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.51.0)
- View report of reponses:  This takes you to an Evaluations report. [(Evaluation reporting 17.5.0)](/help/index/p/17.51.0)

   **Restrict by custom fields**

  - Click on the search bar, as above
  - Under the date and work area options there are a further two search bars.  The first called 'Custom field filters', which lets you select additional filtering options from your organisations' custom fields. (If your organisation has no custom fields then this section will be empty).  
  - Select the field(s) that you would like to filter the records by. 
  - Click the 'Fetch data' button to show records matching these filters.

   **Display additional columns**

   - Click on the search bar, as above. 
   - The final search bar is called 'Additional data columns to display'.  This does not filter, but simply adds additional columns to your table.  
   - Click on these to display names of different {{person}}s or {{organisation}}s who have attended, as well as other items from your evaluation records.
   - Click 'Fetch data' once you have finished to show your results.

   **To change and save your table view**

   To customise the columns shown in the table:
   - Right click in the headings row of the table: this will show you a list of all possible rows. Ticked rows are currently visible in the table, and unticked rows are hidden.  
   - Click on the item you wish to show or hide. 
   - Once you have the table as you want it you can save your changes so this becomes your default table view. Right click again to bring up the pop-up list, and at the bottom choose 'Save table columns layout'. (If you have added additional columns from the 'Additional data columns to display' view, these can also be saved.)This only affects you, not any other database operators.
   - Choose 'Reset table columns layout' to return to the default layout.

   - Click the 'Download' button at the bottom of the table.  
   - Clicking the print button will open a new tab, with the table in a print friendly format.  
   - Split print allows you to create multiple print friendly tables, split by whatever item you choose.
