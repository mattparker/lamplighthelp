# 33.6.0 {{Safeguarding}} profile tab

> View the {{safeguarding concern}}s raised for an individual in their profile. 

If information has been shared about a concern, all staff will be able to see that information at the top of the profile.
It appears just below the name.

Profiles can also include a tab listing {{safeguarding case}}s about that person. If you donâ€™t see the tab you may need to
enable it in personal settings.

The tab shows a brief summary of each {{safeguarding case}} in table format. Click on the date of the 
{{safeguarding case}} to view the full detail screen.

The amount of information you can see in this view is limited, and depends on whether you are a {{Safeguarding}} Manager,
{{safeguarding lead contact}}, or regular operator.
