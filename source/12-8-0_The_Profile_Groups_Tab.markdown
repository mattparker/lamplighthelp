The table shows:
- The name of the {{group}}.
- The {{group}} description - this will have been added by the person creating the {{group}} to give more detail of what it is for.
- How many people are in the {{group}} - this will show the number from the last time the {{group}} was run, so if more people have been added since then it may not be up-to-date. To refresh this number, select 'Quick view in popup' or 'View full details' from the {{group}}'s menu (see below).
- What type of {{group}} it is (auto, manual or merge).

Right-clicking on a row of the table or using the menu button to the left of a {{group}} will give you a range of options:

- View full details: allows you to view the {{group}} using a {{group}} data view (see section [13  {{Group}} Data Views](/help/index/p/13)).
 - Quick view in popup: lets you view the names of other members of the {{group}}.
 - Edit: opens the editing window so that you can change the filters.
 - Delete: deletes the {{group}}. This does not remove any data from the system. If you realise that your {{group}} has been deleted in error, you can set up a new one with exactly the same filters. (For more on setting up {{group}}s, see
