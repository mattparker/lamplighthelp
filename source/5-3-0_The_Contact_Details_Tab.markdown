### Contact Details

At the top of the page, you can enter the address details. 

- If you have the postcode look-ups feature enabled, enter the post code and you will see a list of addresses in a pop-up box.

- Click on the correct address in the list, and the details will be automatically added to the appropriate fields. 
- The look-up is based on Ordnance Survey data and is accurate in most locations. If you do not see the correct address click on the screen away from the pop-up box and enter the details manually.
- If you do not have postcode look-ups, enter the address details in the format agreed within your organisation.
- You can then add other details, such as telephone numbers and email address.
- You may also have some custom fields on this page. If this is the case, you can fill those in on this screen too.
- Once you have finished, click save in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. 

You can also edit just one field in the contact details:
- Open the Contact details tab.
- Double-click on the field that you want to edit.
- Make the changes.
- Click on the 'Save' button to the right.

**When editing a single field, do not click into another field before you have saved your changes**, as this will cause the system to hang. If this happens, click on the 'Contact details' tab at the top of the page again, then re-enter your changes.

### Contact Permissions

This is the second section on the 'Contact details' tab. It shows whether the {{person}} or {{org}} has given permission to contact them. You can edit this section by clicking the 'Edit contact details' button on the right, then saving any changes that you make.

### Role - Main Relationship(s) to You

When a new profile is created in {{Lamplight}}, it will have been given a role. This could be {{user}} or {{staff}}, for example. To change the role that a {{person}} or {{org}} has on your system, or to add another role to their profile, click on the 'Edit roles' button to the right. Once you have finished editing, click 'Save'.
