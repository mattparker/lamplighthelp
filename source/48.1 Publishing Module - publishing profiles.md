# 48.1 Publishing Module - publishing profiles

With the publishing module you have the opportunity to publish profiles from your {{Lamplight}} database onto a public facing site. 
By default no profiles are published, and operators can decide to publish individual records

As part of the initial set-up your System Administrator will have [specified the type of profiles](/help/index/p/134.2) 
they are happy for {{Lamplight}} to publish and what information should be published from within them.

Once the System Administrator has decided what can be published, database operators can choose whether to publish specific profiles.

**By default, no profiles are published.** This is to prevent the accidental publishing of sensitive personal information.

### To Publish a {{Person}} or {{Org}}'s Profile

- Open the profile
- Click on the 'Publishing' tab.

In this tab you will be able to see:
- Whether the profile can be published.
- Whether it is currently published.
- Whether it can be updated via the Publishing API.

#### Publishing Settings

You will be able to see at the top of the page whether the profile can be published or not.  If it can be published, 
find the field 'Publish this profile via the API?', and tick the box.

The 'Published summary' field is a built-in free text field that may be displayed on the public-facing site. Other custom fields
may also be published, but this will depend on the settings your System Administrator has chosen.

**Click 'save'.**

The profile is now being published to whatever public-facing sites have been set up to show this data. When you click save you'll see
additional information below, listing out the raw data that will be available as published data.

### Data That's Published

The publishing tab within the profile gives a read-only view of the information being published. Any alterations to the information being published 
will need to be done from within the tab where that data sits usually, with the exception of the 'Publish summary' field, 
which you can edit directly in the publishing tab.

### To Remove Sharing from a Profile

- In the 'Publishing' tab, untick the 'Publish this profile via the API?' box.
- Click 'save'.

These changes will be immediately available on your public-facing site.
