# 134.2 Publishing Module: Settings in System Administration

YouYour System Administrator needs to set permissions for the Publishing Module before anything will work. This is done
in a dedicated section of Lamplight system administration.

**Please note:** These settings do not directly publish information, but simply set permissions for what information can
be published.

1. Go to 'admin -> system administration' and in the 'Module Settings' section towards the bottom you will find
  the 'Publishing Module' box.
2. Click 'Manage publishing settings'. 
3. On this page are several tabs controlling how publishing works within the system.

#### Overall Publishing Details

The options in this tab control the type of information can be published and updated from an external site. Simply
select the options you want. You will then need to go to the specific tabs to set the detail of what can be published.

![Publishing Settings - tab 1](134.2a_publishing_settings)

You can choose whether to:

1. Publish profiles out from Lamplight
2. Allow profiles to be created.
3. Allow existing profiles to be updated (*).
4. Allow relationships to be created between profiles (*).
5. Publish details of {{work}} records.
6. Accept {{referral}}s in to your system
7. Allow profiles to be added to {{group}}s or {{waiting list}}s (*).

The items marked (*) can only be carried out using the API, not through widgets. In other words you'll need a developer
to set this up.

#### {{People}} and {{Org}}s Tabs

You will see a separate tabe for each of the profile types you have in your system. For example, if you have
{{People}} and {{Org}}s, you will see two tabs. This means you can control access more precisely, perhaps allowing
profiles of people into your system only, and organisations out only for a directory.


![Details of Profile That Can Be Published - tab 2](134.2b_publish_profile)

In these tabs you can choose:

- which roles can be published.
- what profile details can be published.
- what profile information can be added to Lamplight from a website/application.
- what profile information can be updated within Lamplight from a website/application.

Custom profile fields can also be set to be published and/or updated, but this is set in the main [system admin
section for those fields](help/index/p/104).

A reminder: once these permissions are set each profile that you wish to publish will also need to be published individually.

If you want to allow the addition of new profiles, you can also control whether they should be accepted directly
into your system as is, or be placed in a "holding area" first. The default option is to place them in the 
holding area so they can be [reviewed by a member of staff](/help/index/p/48.7) before being added to the system.

#### {{Work}} settings tab

{{Work}} records may be published out of your system to create event listings. You can also control what data is made
available from within those published records. As with profiles, custom field data can also be published from fields
that have [been set to allow it](help/index/p/104.3.1).

![The {{Work}} settings tab](134.2d_work_settings.png)

Although you can't create {{work}} records using the module, you can accept attendees to them: this is covered in
the 'Data In Settings' in this tab.

![{{Work}} in settings](134.2e_work_in.png)

Attendees at records are identified by email address or their Lamplight ID. If you use a publishing widget that
accepts attendees, there is an email address field within the widget, so people will need to be in your system
already to be added to the record.

When someone tries to add themself to a {{work}} record through the publishing module using their email address,
Lamplight will
- search for the email address
- if it finds one match, it will add them to the {{work}} record with the attendance type and role selected in settings
- if it finds no matches, it will create a {{message}} for the system admin letting you know, with the email address
- if it finds more than one match, it will create a {{message}} for the system admin letting you know, with the email address,
but it will not add them to the record.

Identifying people by ID is more reliable, but is more likely to be useful if you have a developer adding a 
custom integration.

If you use the sign-in functionality with QR codes, the QR code embeds the Lamplight ID of the profile, so people
signing in using a QR code will not face any issues that you do with email addresses.

### {{Referral}} Tab

{{Referral}} records cannot be published out, but can be accepted in. If this is enabled in the first tab you 
can set various settings for the {{referral}} records created. The {{workarea}} can be over-written by different 
widgets or in API calls. Custom field data can also be accepted for fields that have been enabled to do so.

![Details of {{referral}} record settings](134.2f_referral.png)

The same approach to identifying the profile referred is used in {{referral}} records as with {{work}} records.
However, if you use a 'Create a profile and {{referral}} widget', Lamplight will create the profile and add that
profile to the {{referral}} record, so they don't need to be in the system already.

#### {{Project}}s

If you have multiple Lamplight {{project}}s you can choose which ones will allow publishing.

#### API Key and Details

If you are using Lamplight widgets, you won't need this. If you are building your own integration with a developer
using the API, you will need these details.

The API key and details tab are the credentials your website will need to access data in {{Lamplight}} - think of this
as a username and password that your website needs in order to get information into or out of {{Lamplight}}. It should
be kept securely within your integration.

![API key details](134.2g_api_key.png)

- This section gives you the API key you will need to access Lamplight remotely. Give these details to your programmer.
- To generate a new API key, click the checkbox and choose ‘save’. Previous keys will no longer function, and you’ll
  need to update your applications and programming.

You will have different API details for each {{project}}, if relevant.

We recommend specifying the IP address(es) of the server that will be making the API calls. This is not essential, but it does
add a further layer of security to your system.
