# 23.0.0 The Data Direct Module

The Data Direct Module allows you to send your users a web (URL) link for them to click to complete your questionnaires/forms online, directly. You can use the questionnaires/forms that you have already set up as evals or {{outcome}}s for others to complete outside of Lamplight. An online, external form. When they complete the form, their responses are automatically saved to Lamplight.

The Data Direct Module {{work}}s with the Evals Module, allowing you to create web (URL) links to your existing surveys/evals, as well as the core system {{outcome}}s.
 - Step 1 - to ensure you’ve got the form templates in the system, or you can [128.1 {{Eval}}s Module: Setting Up Evaluations](/help/index/p/128.1) or [111 {{
 - Outcome}} - Adding and Editing and Deleting Categories, Measures and Descriptors](/help/index/p/11) within system administration.
- Step 2 - to create a &#039;{{campaign}}&#039;, to specify the details of the online form
- Step 3 – generate the URL ready to send/give to users

You have control over:
- presentation – use your logo and colour scheme
- anonymity (for eval {{campaign}}s) – should responses be linked to profiles or not?
- who’s completing them, and when they can do so

With {{outcome}} {{campaign}}s, you can:
- have a different link for each {{person}}, so that you can track who has responded, and with what information
- have their responses entered automatically into Lamplight and displayed in their profile (table view or radar chart)

With eval {{campaign}}s, you can also:
- {{report}} on a particular eval {{campaign}}, or on all answers for the same eval in a particular timeframe. - send out one link to everyone
