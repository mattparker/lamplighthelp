# 28.0.0 The Publishing Module

> The Publishing Module adds the ability to connect a website or application to Lamplight using your Lamplight API



If you use the Publishing Module you can link information entered in Lamplight to your public website.  For example, you might want:

- A staff directory, pulled from the staffing information in Lamplight.
- A directory of local voluntary organisations (especially for CVSs and the like).
- A searchable directory of local services for people seeking support.
- A ‘what’s on’ listing of forthcoming events.

You choose what records and information to publish, so you are in full control of your data.  You also decide exactly how you want to present it on your website – we just link you to the data.

In addition you can, if you want, accept data into Lamplight.  For example, you can allow people to refer themselves through your website, book on forthcoming events, or update their profile information.

We’ve set up a whole website, http://www.lamplight-publishing.co.uk/, which gives some working examples and documentation to show how it works.  It’s aimed at developers and other technical types to show how to get the data out of Lamplight and on to your website.  

You will need a developer to add the Lamplight information to your website.
