[{{Report}}s](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/p/tagged_Reports)
{{Report}}s in Lamplight show numerical summaries of the data held in the system. This could be of the {{work}} you have done, the impact you&#039;ve had or funding that you have received, for example.

![34 Creating and Running {{Report}}s - step 1](34_Creating_and_Running_Reports_im_1.png)

There is a lot of flexibility in how you filter and present the information. There are some aspects of {{report}}s which are common to all (or most) (see [36 Report Filters](/help/index/p/36), and some that are specific to each different one.
Please note that you need to have {{Staff}}, Manager, System Administrator or {{Report}}er database operator level to view and run {{report}}s.
To set up and view {{report}}s:
Click &#039;{{Report}}s&#039; on the main menu.
Click on the name of the {{report}} that you want on the menu bar (if you can&#039;t im{{media}}tely see it, click the &#039;more&#039; option).
Core {{Report}}s
All systems will have these so long as they are activated in global settings.
{{Work}} {{report}}s count the number of profiles you&#039;ve {{work}}ed with, time taken and attendances (see [35.1 Work Reports Overview](/help/index/p/35.1)).
{{Outcome}} {{report}}s show the impact of your {{work}}, and the average changes that have been seen (see [35.3 Outcomes Report Overview](/help/index/p/35.3)).
{{Referral}} {{report}}s count and summarise the {{referral}}s that have occurred within any time frame (see [14.5 {{Referral}} {{Report}}s](https://lamplight.online/en/help/index/14.5)).
{{Linked case}} {{report}}s provide a summary of the records in {{linked case}}s and allow analysis of open and closed {{linked case}}s within any time period (see [35.6 Case Reports](/help/index/p/35.6)).
{{Grant}} {{report}}s show summary data on the {{grant}}s you&#039;ve entered onto cold call {{org}}s profiles (see [35.8 Grant Reports](/help/index/p/35.8)).
Module {{Report}}s
You will only see these on your system if you have the module.
{{Comm}} {{report}}s count and present information on {{comm}}s made (see [35.10 The Communications Report](/help/index/p/35.1)).
{{Eval}} {{report}}s summarise responses to {{eval}} questionnaires (see [35.12 The Evaluation Report](/help/index/p/35.12)).
Matching module {{report}}s show the number of matches and {{volunteer}}ing opportunity and {{volunteer}}ing applications registered and requested, and the number of different profiles involved (see [35.14 Volunteering Opportunity and Volunteering Application Reports](/help/index/p/35.14)).
{{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s breakdown how {{staff}}/net{{work}} partner time is spent, captured via the {{Staff}} Management Module (see [35.16  Staff Timesheet Report](/help/index/p/35.16)).
{{Waiting {{group}}}} {{report}}s show the numbers of profiles on {{waiting {{group}}}}s, and the average waiting time for each (see [35.17 The Waiting List Report](/help/index/p/35.17)).
