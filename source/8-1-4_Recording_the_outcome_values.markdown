# 8.1.4 <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Recording the {{Outcome}} Values

> After the 'When and where' and 'Attendance' tabs, the next tabs that you see are for recording {{outcome}} scores



Each different set of {{outcome}} measures that you have in your system will have its own tab in the {{outcome}} record. In our example system, these are the {{outcome}}s we are measuring (outlined in the red box):

![Example {{outcome}} categories](8.1.4a.png)

You may also have some tabs relating to modules in your system - these are outlined in green in the above picture.

- Click on any tab to see the measures in the {{outcome}} and record scores for them. 

These {{outcome}}s will either be recorded as:

   - Yes/no (e.g. 'do they have a job?').
   - Scores (e.g. 'on a scale of 1-5, how happy are you with your job?').
   - Amounts (e.g. 'how many hours/week do you work?').

When entering {{outcome}}s you will either see a drop-down box with yes-no options, or if they are expecting scores or amounts, a box into which you type the number.  You may see also see some explanatory text to the right of the {{outcome}}s.

Once you have entered the actual score or yes/no, you can also add a comment to the score. The comment can be any text, perhaps an explanation or evidence. It is not a field that can be reported on, but it can be seen when viewing the saved record, as a column in the  table view on the {{Outcome}}s tab (for more on this see [8.2.0 The {{Outcome}}s Tab](/help/index/p/8.2.0) or as a column in the {{outcome}}s table (see [8.3.0 Viewing All {{Outcome}} Records](/help/index/p/8.3.0).

The 'our work' tick box means that you can record changes in the {{person}}'s situation, even if they are not the result of your work. This is for reference only and can be seen if you view the completed {{outcome}}s record.

You can enter information for as few or as many {{outcome}}s as you wish. When you have finished, click the 'save' button at the bottom-right of the page. 

If you're new to {{outcome}}s, why not [take a look at our video](/help/index/p/51.5.1)?
