> {{Lamplight}} stores details of the {{work}} you do (services you provide) as {{work}} records



{{Lamplight}} holds details of the {{work}} you do with your {{user}}s. These are called {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}. Each time you provide a service, you will probably enter it as a {{work}} record. 

Each {{work}} record stores information about:
- When and where it happened.
- Who was there.
- What happened.
