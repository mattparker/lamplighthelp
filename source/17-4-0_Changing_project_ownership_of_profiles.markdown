# 17.4.0 <i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Changing {{Project}} Ownership of Profiles

> If you have more than one {{project}}, each profile is 'owned' by the {{project}} that created it.  You can change which {{project}} owns a profile in the '{{project}} sharing' tab in their profile


A profile is 'owned' by the {{project}} in which it was created, and it may be shared from that {{project}} with others.  However, you may need to move it to a different {{project}} for some reason.

In the {{project}} that owns the profile, navigate to the profile and click the 'project sharing' tab.  At the bottom of this tab there is a dropdown that allows you to change the ownership.

**Please note**: you may 'lose' control of the profile once this has been done, if you don't have access to the {{project}} that you're moving it to.

If you cannot see the dropdown, please contact us at Lamplight and we can enable this functionality for you.
