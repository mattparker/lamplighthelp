21.1.3 The {{Comm}}s Module: {{Comm}} Roles

> {{Comm}} roles mean that you can assign different roles to {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in {{comm}}s. These are like roles in {{activity}} record attendance tables, and you can set up as many as you need 

When creating a {{comm}} record, each profile involved is assigned a role. This list of the roles that you have in your system appears in the table in the ‘Recipients’ tab when sending a {{comm}}.
