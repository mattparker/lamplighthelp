# 16.8.5  <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Printing profiles with print tempaltes

> You can set up print templates that can be used to print certain parts of a profile, and add additional standard text
> and styles.

[Printing profiles](/help/index/p.5.7.0) allows operators to produce printer friendly versions of complete profiles, and
then to select certain tabs and other layouts. If you often need to print only certain elements of a profile
(or save to pdf), or need to use custom styles or header and footer text, then print templates can save you a lot of
time.

To create a print template, go to admin > system administration and select 'Print profile templates' in the 'Templates'
menu.

This will list existing templates, which you can edit or delete, and allow you to create new ones:

Click the button to create a new template, and complete the fields as required:

- Template name: will appear in the 'print' button menu on profiles, so make it descriptive for your team
- 'Show your logo' - if you've [added your logo](/help/index/p/16.17.0) (it'll be in the top-left of your Lamplight
  screen if you have) then it can be displayed at the top of the printed profile.
- Header text will be displayed at the top of the page, before any profile information
- Footer text will be at the very end. You can use these for things like confidentiality notices, security markings, or
  other standard information
- Print without page breaks for each tab - whether you want each tab to start on a new page (the default) or be a
  continuous document (tick the box)
- Num table rows - how many rows of each table to display
- The date in the corner is the 'date printed' information that's added by default
- Then select the profile tabs you wish to appear, by ticking the checkbox next to them. Drag and drop the boxes to
  re-order them if needed.
- Custom CSS allows you to alter the formatting of the printed profile, if needed. CSS is how web pages are styles, so
  you can change the font, size, colour, borders etc, if you need to. You may need assistance from a web developer or
  similar person if you need to make these types of change.

Save the template. It will now be available to all operators, in the 'print' button that appears in the top right of all
profiles.
