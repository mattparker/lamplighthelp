5. Click on Filter your records for more options
   - Related to a particular {{workarea}} or {{subworkarea}}: choose it from the list. If you choose more than one, you will see campaigns which relate to any of the areas chosen rather than to all of them.
   - Related to the staff member who added or edited it last: choose the relevant staff member from the drop-down list.
   - To show deleted campaigns: tick the 'show deleted records' box. If you choose this, no undeleted campaigns will be shown in the table.
   - Show records attended by members of a {{group}} or {{waiting list}}: select from the drop-down the {{group}} required. When used, this will only bring up a table of campaigns that the members of the {{group}} are included in. If you're unsure who is currently in the {{list}}, you can view them via the main menu bar and either '{{list}}s > view > view all' or for {{waiting list}}s '{{work}} > view > {{waiting list}}s'.
   - To show only campaigns using a specific {{eval}}: choose the relevant one from the drop-down list.
   - Select the field(s) that you would like to filter the records by.

From this menu, tick the 'Their URL' option and a column will be added to the table showing the individual URL for each person.

17. Click on Edit {{campaign}} details

You'll see that some items are blanked out: to prevent data inconsistencies you cannot change the {{eval}} template, {{workarea}}, or the separate page option.

In addition, for 'separate page' campaigns, you cannot remove invitees who have already responded: the red cross to delete will not be visible in the invitees table. 

When you have made the changes you want to, click the 'save' button.  They will immediately be 'live' for anyone viewing the survey.

![43.3 Data Direct {{Work}}ing With Existing {{Campaign}}s - step 17](43.3_Data_Direct_Working_With_Existing_Campaigns_im_17.png)

18. Click on save

![43.3 Data Direct {{Work}}ing With Existing {{Campaign}}s - step 18](43.3_Data_Direct_Working_With_Existing_Campaigns_im_18.png)

Other options under the context menu:
- Delete: deletes the campaign.  You cannot undo this.

You can only delete campaigns that have not had any responses. If you try to delete one that has some replies saved, you will receive an error message. 

If you want to stop an existing campaign, you can edit it to change the 'date to' to the current time and date, which will prevent any more responses. Anyone attempting to respond to it will see an error message. 

- Duplicate record: duplicates the campaign, so that if it is similar to one you are setting up you can alter the details rather than creating one from scratch.

- Email all invitees/have responded/not yet responded: takes you to a {{comm}}s page to email these invitees (for more see [43.1 Data Direct: Communicating With invitees Of Campaigns](/help/index/p/43.1)).

- For {{eval}} campaigns only: View report of responses: takes you to an {{eval}}s report (for more see [35.12 The {{Eval}} Report](/help/index/p/35.12)).

19. At the bottom of the page, shows the options to &#039;download&#039;, &#039;print&#039; or &#039;split print&#039;
