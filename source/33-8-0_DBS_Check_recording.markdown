# 33.8.0 DBS Check recording

> You can record details of DBS checks carried out and receive reminders when renewals are due.

The application and results of DBS checks can be recorded in individual profiles. You will need to make sure
the profile is the correct type, and that you have the tab selected in personal settings.

In the profile tab you will see a listing of all DBS checks carried out. To add a new one click the 'add' button.
This will show you the following screen.

Fill in the details that you know. You may complete this initially when applying, and then edit it when the results
are returned.  Click 'save' when you are done.

To edit an existing record, right click the DBS check from the profile listing, and select 'edit' from the popup menu.

### Who can view DBS records?

{{Safeguarding}} Managers can view all DBS records. You can also assign operators to have access to DBS records without
providing them with full access to {{safeguarding case}}s.  To do so, edit their database operator profile (admin > 
system administration > Manage database operators) and tick the 'Give this operator access to DBS records?' box.


### {{Safeguarding}} / DBS Home Page Tab

Operators at Manager level and above may view DBS checks to the home page. This tab lists newly raised 
{{safeguarding case}}s and DBS Checks that expire within the next month (or other period set in global settings).

### {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard

A DBS status summary can be viewed on the {{Safeguarding}} Dashboard. This lists profiles that have expiring DBS checks,
and also profiles that don't have one at all.

### All DBS Checks Carried out

A list of all DBS checks can be viewed via the system admin menu. Go to Admin > System Administration on the main menu.
Then 'View all DBS Check records' in 'Database Operators And Security'. To see all profiles and their DBS status, click 
'View list of profiles and their DBS Check status' in the same place.
