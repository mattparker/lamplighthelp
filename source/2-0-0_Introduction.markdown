# 2.0.0    Introduction

> An overview of {{Lamplight}} and the contents of the online help system. 

{{Lamplight}} is a fully featured management system for charities and voluntary sector organisations. 

This manual starts by explaining the **general concepts and language** we use in the system, and how to **navigate** around the system and use some of the common controls (sections [3.0.0  General concepts](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.0.0) and [4.0.0  Navigation and controls](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.0.0)). There are also some answers to Frequently Asked Questions (**FAQs**) in section [5.0.0  Frequently Asked Questions](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/5.0.0).

Sections [6.0.0  Logging In](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/6.0.0) and [7.0.0  Homepage](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/7.0.0) **get you started** - how to log in and what's on the home page. The subsequent chapters explain how to **add, edit and view records** in the system. In some areas you will see reference to 'Modules': these are optional additions to {{Lamplight}} that provide extra features if they are needed. If you do not have these modules enabled these sections will be slightly greyed out and with a message and the information will not apply to your system. Please contact us if you would like to turn these features on on your system.

The **{{report}}**s available in {{Lamplight}} are covered in section [17.0.0  {{Report}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.0.0), which provides details of how to generate different {{report}}s, and some help on what they might mean.

The final sections cover **system administration**, changes from previous versions, troubleshooting, and some pointers to help when setting up your system for the first time.

Each section starts with a brief summary or 'how-to'; you may only need to read the summary for a quick reminder. Each section then has detailed text and in many cases screenshots that explains in detail how to accomplish a particular task or use a feature of Lamplight.

The manual is available as a download, or online through the 'help' option on the main menu.
