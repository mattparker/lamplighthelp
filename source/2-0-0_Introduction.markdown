# 2.0.0    Introduction

> An overview of {{Lamplight}} and the contents of the online help system. 

{{Lamplight}} is a powerful, web-based management system for charities and voluntary sector organisations. It is designed with day-to-day tasks in mind, as well as the reporting required by management and funders. The system is centred around:
-	the **people** you work with
-	the **work** you do and services you offer 
-	the **impact** that work is having

In this manual you will find information on the **general concepts and language** we use in the system, and how to **navigate** around the system and use some of the common controls (sections [3.0.0  General concepts](/help/index/p/3.0.0) and [4.0.0  Navigation and controls](/help/index/p/4.0.0)).

Sections [6.0.0  Logging In](/help/index/p/6.0.0) and [7.0.0  Homepage](/help/index/p/7.0.0) **get you started**, explaining how to log in and what's on the home page. The subsequent chapters explain how to **add, edit and view records** in the system. You will also find support for 'Modules'. These are optional additions to {{Lamplight}} that provide extra features. You may not have them in your system, and if this is the case the sections will be slightly greyed out. If you are interested in turning any of these on in your system please get in touch. 

The **{{report}}s** available in {{Lamplight}} are covered in section [17.0.0, {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/17.0.0). This explains how to set up and run different {{report}}s and add filters to get more detailed information. 

There is also a section on how to manage your system if you're an administrator, [18.0.0, **System Administration**](/help/index/p/18.0.0).

If you would like a paper copy of this manual, just choose 'download' from the help menu.
