# 16.10.0 Creating {{Activity}} List Templates

> {{Activity}} list templates can be used to view your {{work}} and other activities records. They are similar to report templates, letting you save the criteria that you want to use to search so that you can choose it from a menu list

You can create templates to view different types of activity record in Lamplight – for example {{work}}, {{outcome}}s, or {{referral}}s (you may not use all of these in your system).

**To Create a Template**

- Go to 'system administration' and in the 'Activity List Template' section select 'Add, edit and remove activity list templates'. 
- Find the section showing the type of activity you want to create a template for. 
- At the bottom of this section, click add.

- You must give your activity list template a name and description. The name is what you will see in future in the list to choose from, so it should be short and self-explanatory. 
- If needed, you can choose to lock your template so that other administrators can’t change it.
- The next pages are where you choose the filters and any extra columns to display. Once you have all you need, click save.
- This new template will now appear in a sub-list on the main menu.
