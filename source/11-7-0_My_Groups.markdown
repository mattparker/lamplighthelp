# 11.7.0 My {{Group}}s

> You can see the {{group}}s that you have created or edited most recently from the main menu

{{Group}}s which you create or view will temporarily be tagged by the system as belonging to you. This means that you can see a list of the most recent ones if you go to the main menu: '{{group}}s-> my {{group}}s'. 

![My {{Group}}s](11.7.0a.png)

Clicking on the name of the {{group}} will show you the simple list of members. If you want to edit the {{group}} you will need to find it in the 'all {{group}}s' table. For more on this, see [11.6.0 Editing {{Group}}s]9/help/index/p/11.6.0).
