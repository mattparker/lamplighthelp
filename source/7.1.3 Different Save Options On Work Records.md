# [# In Lamplight when creating a new {{work}} record, you have different save options, to save time on other data entry {{message}}s](https://new.lamplight.online/en/edit/form/what/happen/form/work)

1. When a {{work}} record is ready to be saved, click on the drop down {{group}} next to the save button at the bottom of the screens, to see the options available
Some of these will only show if you have the module/area turned on in Lamplight
View saved record: will show you the {{work}} record on screen that has been saved
Add another record like this: will open new {{work}} record, with all details copied across including date, {{work}} area, attendance and any notes
Add {{outcome}}s for {{people}} attending: will open a new {{outcome}}s record for the service user attending
Add {{referral}} record for {{people}} attending: will open a new {{referral}} record with details (E.g. {{work}} area, attendances) copied to the new record
Add {{grant}} record for {{people}} attending: will open a new {{grant}} record with details (E.g. {{work}} area, attendances) copied to the new record
Add {{eval}} {{Linked case}} Study Template: will open a new {{eval}} record for a particular {{eval}} (E.g. {{Linked case}} Study Template) with details (E.g. {{work}} area, attendances) copied to the new record
Add {{eval}}s Feedback Form: will open a new {{eval}} record for a particular {{eval}} (E.g. Feedback Form) with details (E.g. {{work}} area, attendances) copied to the new record
Do not save this record: save it as a template instead: this allows you to set fields which will be pre populated when creating a new {{work}} record
Do not save this record: reset saved template instead: will reset the standard new {{work}} record to be blank
