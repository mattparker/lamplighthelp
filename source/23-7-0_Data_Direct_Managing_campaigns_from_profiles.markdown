# 23.7.0 Data Direct: Managing campaigns from profiles

> {{Lamplight}} allows the flexibility for invitees to your campaigns to be managed within their profile

Invitees for your Data Direct campaigns can be managed from the main menu bar and as explained in [23.2.0 Data Direct: Setting up a campaign](/help/index/p/23.2.0). It is also possible to add your invitees directly from their profile and email them directly.


To manage an {{eval}} or {{outcome}} campaign from a profile
- Via the search bar in the top right hand corner, go to the profile you wish to send the campaign to
- Click on the {{eval}}/{{outcome}} tab
- Select (on the right hand side) the ‘Datadirect Campaigns’ button.

-	ID of the campaign
- Title of the campaign
- Start and End dates of the campaign
- Is in the campaign? – If this is marked as ‘yes’ the profile you’re in will already have a URL assigned to them within the campaign
- Is email text set to send invite? – If this is marked as ‘yes’ then an email template has already been created for this campaign. For details about templates please see [23.3 Data Direct: Communicating with Invitees of Campaigns](/help/index/p/23.3.0)
