# 5.5 Duplicate Profiles

**When you add a new profile to {{Lamplight}}, the system will check to see if it is a duplicate. If there is already a {{person}} or {{org}} with the same or similar name, it will be flagged up**

1. If you try to add a new profile with a similar name to an already existing profile, a screen will appear saying ‘Checking for Duplicate Profiles’

2. You will then have different options about how to proceed:
- If you&#039;re sure this is not a duplicate, click on the &#039;create the new profile&#039; option at the top
- If you want to view the possible duplicate profile, click on the name
- If this is a duplicat profile, you can either click on 'view all profiles' or 'add different profile' and the profile will not be saved
