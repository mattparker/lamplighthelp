> It is possible for system and project administrators to request a new password for an operator, and to see it as it is reset



To ask for the password to be reset:

- On the database operator's table, find the database operator then use the menu button on the left-hand side, or right click on their name.
- Select reset password from the pop-up menu.

- A pop-up window will appear confirming that the password has been reset and emailed. It will also show what the newly sent password is.

This password will only be used once - when the database operator logs in they will be asked to reset it.
