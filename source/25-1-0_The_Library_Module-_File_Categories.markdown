# 25.1.0 The Library Module: File Categories

> Setting up the Library Module for use is relatively simple: you just need to create some file categories. You will use these to categorise the contents of your library and as filters when searching



System Administrators can create  categories which are added to uploaded files and used to filter library searches. You can add new items and edit and delete old ones at any time.

### Setting Up File Categories
- Go to ‘admin -> system administration’.
- Find the 'Module Administration' section towards the bottom of the page. 
- In the 'Library Module' boxk click 'Manage library categories’.
- On the list page, double-click where it says ‘double click to add’ at the bottom of the list of existing categories.
- Type the name of the category in the text fieled that opens up.
- When you have finished, press the ‘Enter’ key on your keyboard to save.

### Editing a File Category
Existing file categories can be edited from the same screen:
- Double-click the category in the list. 
- Type the new text and press ‘Enter’ to save.
### Please note: it is best not to change the meaning of existing categories if they already have library items linked to them. The existing items will remain linked once the category has been edited.
### Changing the List Order
- Click on the item in the list that you would like to re-order, then drag and drop it where you would like it to go (left-click and hold the button down while you move your cursor to the new position, before releasing). 
- The other options will adjust to make space for it.

### Deleting a List Item
- Find the item that you would like to delete in the list. 
- Drag it to the end of the list and drop it in the grey box labelled ‘Drag here to delete’.
