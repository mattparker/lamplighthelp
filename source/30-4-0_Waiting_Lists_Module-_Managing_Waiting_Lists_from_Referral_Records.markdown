# 30.4.0 {{Waiting List}}s Module: Managing {{Waiting List}}s from {{Referral}} Records

> {{People}} and {{org}}s can be added to {{waiting list}}s from a {{referral}} record



To add a {{person}} or {{org}} to a {{waiting list}} from a {{referral}} record:

- Open a new {{referral}} record (for more information on this see [6.1.0 Adding a {{referral}} Record](/help/index/p/6.1.0)). 
- Fill in the record as usual. 
- Towards the bottom of the 'Details' tab, there is an 'Also add this person to a waiting list' option. 
- Select the appropriate {{waiting list}} from the drop-down box. 
- The {{person}} that you are adding must also be recorded on the 'Attendance' tab as 'Attended' and 'Service user referred' to be added to the {{waiting list}}.
- When all the details within the {{referral}} record have been completed, click 'save' at the bottom right of any page.
- The {{user}} will have be added automatically to the chosen {{waiting list}}. 
- The date they joined the {{waiting list}} will be the date chosen for the {{referral}} record (in the 'When and where' tab), NOT the date the record was entered into {{Lamplight}}.
