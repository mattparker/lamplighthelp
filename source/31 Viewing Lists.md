![31 Viewing {{Group}}s - step 3](31_Viewing_Lists_im_3.png)
4. If you want to see all the columns that you can have in your table, right-clicking on the coloured header row at the top will bring up a menu of the available options. You can tick and untick to add and remove columns.
This menu also has the option of an &#039;ID&#039; column - this is not usually shown by default. Each {{group}} has its own unique ID number, allocated by the system in the order that {{group}}s are created. If this column is visible in your table, left-clicking the top of it will sort your {{group}}s in order from the one created first down to the most recently added. Clicking again will show them in the reverse order.

5. You can change the order of the columns by using the &#039;&lt; Left&#039; and &#039;Right &gt;&#039; buttons under the Move columns heading

# {{Group}} Context Menu
7. In the left-hand column of the table you may see a menu button next to each {{group}}. Clicking on this will bring up the context menu. If you can&#039;t see this column, right-clicking on any row of the table will give you the same menu.

8. Options on the menu
View members: click on this to see all the profiles of the {{group}} link
Use the black arrow and with a data view to see all the data views in your system and choose one with which to view the {{group}}. For more on this, link
Tag item &#039;select tags&#039;: This allows you to organise your {{group}}s into categories. Tags can be set up in System Administration
Edit {{group}}: choose this to open the {{group}} editing dialogue and change details of the filters in your {{group}}. For more on this, see link
Duplicate {{group}}: you can make an exact copy of the {{group}}. This is useful if you have a {{group}} which is very similar to another, as you can duplicate the original and then edit the details for the second one
Covert {{group}} to a manual {{group}}: you can convert auto and merge {{group}}s to manual {{group}}s, this means the profiles on the {{group}} will remain the same unless manually added or removed
{{Comm}} with {{group}}: Allows you to create letters, word documents and labels to the {{group}} of profiles
Create email to {{group}}: Allows you to send an email (if set up in Lamplight) to the {{group}} of profiles
View MailChimp status: Allows you to see status of the {{group}} in MailChimp (if the {{Comm}}s module is added and the integration has been set up in Lamplight)
Print {{group}} member profiles: choosing this option brings up a new window where you can see all the profile details for each member of the {{group}}. You can select which of these details you want to print. For more on printing profile details, see link This will take some time for a large {{group}}
Delete {{group}}: If you know that you are not going to need this {{group}} again then you can delete it here. Once you have done this you can&#039;t undelete it. This does not remove any records or profile information from the system, and it is possible to set up a new {{group}} with the same filters if you delete one in error
