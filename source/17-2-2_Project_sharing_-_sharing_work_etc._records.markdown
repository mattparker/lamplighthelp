# 17.2.2    {{Project}} sharing - sharing {{activity}} records

> {{Work}}, {{outcome}}, and {{referral}} and other {{activity}} records can be shared between {{project}}s 

If you have {{project}} sharing enabled, then when adding a new {{work}} record you will see an additional drop-down box in the 'When and where' tab: 'Share this record with other{{project}}s'. 

You can choose a sharing policy from this drop-down list - the default option is always 'No sharing'. 

Other policies set up by your system administrator will appear below this: please check directly with them if you are unsure about which to use. 

Continue adding your {{work}} record details and save as usual.

When you view a completed {{work}} record, you'll see a 'sharing' section near the bottom. If the record is not being shared, this will look something like this:

![{{work}} {{project}} sharing - no sharing](235a.png)

If a record is being shared, it will look more like this:

![{{work}} {{project}} sharing - sharing](235b.png)

This box shows - what is being shared and with whom. If you need to change this, you can edit the {{work}} record and select a different option in the sharing drop-down.

If you share a {{work}} record, but have not shared the profiles of those attending, when someone views the {{work}} record in another {{project}}, they will not see the names of the {{people}}, just blank rows. However, if you have shared both the {{people}} and {{work}} record they will be visible, and the {{work}} record will be listed in the '{{work}} records tab of the shared person's profile.
