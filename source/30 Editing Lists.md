'My users' restriction means you cannot edit manual {{group}}s.
If you are affected by the 'my user' restriction (meaning you are limited to what profiles you are able to access) then you will not be able to edit manual {{group}}s. This is because you won't necessarily see who's in the {{group}}, and when you edit it those profiles will be removed, without you realising (because you don't have access to them). Higher level operators will need to edit the {{group}} in these circumstances.

See the 'my user' restriction manual pages for more information.
