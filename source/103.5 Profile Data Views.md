Tab 5 of the Operator Template is The Profile Data View. Add dataviews to customise what information is shown in different areas of the system

1. Create a ‘Summary’ tab by using the ‘{{Group}} data view to use as summary tab on profiles’ dropdown

![103.5 Profile Data Views - step 2](103.5_Profile_Data_Views_im_2.png)

This is a new tab in a profile, made of information pulled different tabs in that profile. It&#039;s designed to bring together information to view (only) in one place. Information is not editable in this tab

This is what a summary tab can look like in a profile:

2. To add a header strip to profiles, click on the drop down {{group}} for ‘Default {{group}} data view to use in heading on profiles (default)’ to see a {{group}} of data views you can create a header from

Like the summary tab, this takes information from different parts of the profile. In this {{linked case}} it presents it in a strip at the top. This is what it will look like in the profile:

3. Set the a default header for all profiles, or choose  different header dataviews for different types of profile (the types of profile you see may be different in your system to those here)

![103.5 Profile Data Views - step 6](103.5_Profile_Data_Views_im_6.png)

If you set a ‘default’ header, this will be used for any profile types that don’t have their own header view specified.

4. The ‘If you have a profile header {{group}} data view, show empty fields?’ checkbox is ticked by default, so empty fields will show as well as those where there is data

![103.5 Profile Data Views - step 7](103.5_Profile_Data_Views_im_7.png)

If you uncheck it, only fields which have information in them will be shown

5. Choose a dataview to use when looking at relationships in the profile tab from the ‘{{Group}} data view to use in relationships tab’ dropdown
This information will be added to the standard columns in the relationships table you see in the profile ‘Relationships’ tab. For example, the dataview used here only contains ‘Profile role’ data.

6. You have the option to save your progress at the bottom of this page. You can then continue {{work}}ing through the operator template settings
