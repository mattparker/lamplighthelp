# 4.1 Using the Search Function

You can use the Lamplight search to find profiles, records and text.


### To find a profile:
1. Click on the search icon â€“ the magnifying glass at the top right of the screen

2. Start typing the name of the {{person}} you want to look for

![4.1 The Search Function - step 2](4.1_The_Search_Function_im_2.png)

3. Click on the name you want when it appears below the search box

4. This will open the full profile

### To search for a {{postcode}}, phone number, email address, date or free text:
1. Type it into the box in the same format as it is saved in Lamplight

![4.1 The Search Function - step 5](4.1_The_Search_Function_im_5.png)

2. Click the related profile when it appears in the results {{group}}

### To search for an {{activity}} record (e.g. {{work}} or {{referral}}) type the Lamplight ID number of that record into the box:
1. Put the Lampight id of the record in the search box

2. Click on the {{work}} record when it appears below the search box. This will open it to view or edit.

However, if you click the 'search more widely for' button a different search will be carried out. {{Lamplight}} will do a full-text search of the entire system, looking at profiles, {{work}}, {{outcome}} and {{referral}} records, and {{comm}}s (if the {{comm}}s module is enabled) and present the information on a new screen. This search uses a similar approach to web searches.
