# 4.1.0 Diary and My Diary

> By default, the diary shows all that's going on for the current week

The diary shows all that is going on for the current week. In the 'Diary' tab you can view appointments for all {{staff}} who have a profile on Lamplight. The 'My Diary' tab will simply show your own appointments and {{task}}s.

There are a number of ways that you can customise what you see. For more information on this, see:
- [4.1.1 Diary Navigation](help/index/p/4.1.1)
- [4.1.2 Changing What you See in your Diary](help/index/p/4.1.2)

By default when you first log in to {{Lamplight}}, only the My {{User}}s tab will be visible unless this has been set differently by your System Administrator. Please see section [16.4.1 Personal Settings - Logging In and General Settings](/help/index/p/16.4.1) to enable the diary tabs and personalise your settings.
