# 23.5.0    Viewing campaign responses

> View aggregated responses via the DataDirect -> {{eval}} campaigns -> view. 

To view a {{report}} of your campaign responses, view all campaigns (see section [23.3.0  Viewing, edit and delete details of a particular {{Eval}}s Direct campaign](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.3.0)), right-click (or use the menu button) on the campaign you wish to view, and select 'view {{report}} of responses'

This will take you directly to the {{Eval}}s {{report}}, set the dates and other details from your campaign dates, and show you the results.

From there you can carry out further analysis (see section [17.5.0  {{Eval}} {{report}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.5.0) for more help on {{eval}} {{report}}s) and download the results (see section [17.1.4  Exporting {{report}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.4)).
