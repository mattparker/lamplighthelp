# 28.0.0    Publishing Module

> Publishing is different to every other module in that rather than adding sections within Lamplight that you can then use, it adds the ability to connect a website or application to Lamplight using your Lamplight API

The publishing module lets you link information in Lamplight to your public website.  For example, you might want:

- a staff directory, pulled from the staffing information in Lamplight
- a members directory of local voluntary organisations (especially for CVSs and the like)
- a searchable directory of local services for people seeking support
- a ‘what’s on’ listing of forthcoming events

You choose what records and information to publish, keeping you in full control of your data.  And you decide exactly how you want to present it on your website – we get you the data and you can integrate it however you like.

In addition you can, if you want, accept data into Lamplight.  For example, you can allow people to refer themselves through your website, book on forthcoming events, or update their profile information.

We’ve set up a whole website, http://www.lamplight-publishing.co.uk/, which gives some working examples and documentation about how it all works.  It’s aimed at developers and other technical types to show them how to get the data out of Lamplight and on to your website.  

To use the publishing module you’ll need a web developer to add it in to your website.
