# 7 Work Records - Adding New

> {{Lamplight}} stores details of the {{work}} you do (services you provide) as {{work}} records

{{Lamplight}} holds details of the {{work}} you do with your {{user}}s. These are called {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}. Each time you provide a service, you will probably enter it as a {{work}} record. 

There are a number places you can go to add {{work}} records to Lamplight – from the Activities button at the top of the home page, from the diary, from your favourites and from a profile.

### To add a {{Work}} Record from the Activities button:

Click on {{work}} in the main menu bar
