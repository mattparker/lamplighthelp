# 24.0.0    {{Eval}}s Direct Module

> The {{Eval}}s Direct Module allows your to ask your clients to fill out evaluations directly online rather than relying on inputting the data manually. 

The {{Eval}}s Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, to allow you to create online links to your existing surveys/{{eval}}s.

You will have control over:

- presentation – use your logo and colour scheme
- anonymity – should responses be linked to profiles or not?
- who’s completing them, and how long the online {{eval}} is open for


You can report on a particular {{eval}} run, or on all answers for the same {{eval}} in a particular timescale.


Using Lamplight, you can send out one link to everyone, or a different link to each person, tracking who has responded, and with what information.  The information they complete is entered automatically into Lamplight, and ready for your analysis.
