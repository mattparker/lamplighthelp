# 30.3.0    Managing {{Waiting List}}s from a Profile

> It is possible to add {{people}}and {{org}}s to {{waiting list}}s directly from their profile 

Within a profile there is a {{Waiting list}} tab (if you have the module and can't see this tab it may be that you have not chosen to view it. See XXXXXXXXX for more about viewing and hiding tabs in a profile). 

When you click on this tab you will see a table of all of the {{waiting list}}s this {{person}} or {{org}} is currently on, if any.

To add them to an existing {{waiting list}}:

- Click on the 'add' button on the right hand side. 
- In the pop-up box, tick the {{waiting list}}(s) as appropriate.
- Click 'save'.

The table in the profile tab will automatically update, showing that the {{person}} or {{org}} has been added to the {{waiting list}}, the date that they joined and the amount of time that they have been on it. 

The context menu for each {{waiting list}} can be accessed via the menu button in the left hand column, or by right-clicking on the relevant row of the table. This gives options to alter, add, view or delete the {{waiting list}} this {{person}} is now a member of. 

This context menu provides the same options as were described when {{waiting list}}s are managed from the main menu (see section [25.2.0  Managing {{waiting list}}s](/help/index/p/25.2.0)).
