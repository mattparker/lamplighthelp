#  16.4.3 Personal Settings - Default Values for Dates on Lists

> This section allows you to set the date-range of {{work}} and other records that will be displayed in a table view. You can also change some other default options for records here, such as the default amount of time given for a {{work}} record

These options relate to how you view your activities records in {{Lamplight}}, as well as customising some of your data entry choices when entering new actities records.

- **Date from type (earliest date) and date from (value)**

   Use these drop-downs to select how far back you would like to show records by default when you open a records table (for example activity>view>{{work}}). You could decide that you would always like to see all records from two years ago or less – so you would choose a ‘date from’ type of years, and the ‘date from’ value of -2. The date from value should always be a minus (-), as it is in the past.

- **Date to type (earliest date) and date to (value)** 

   As with the ‘date from’, you can select how far into the future you would like to show records by default in a records table. For example, if you would like to see them for 1 month into the future, choose a ‘date to type’ of months and a ‘date to value’ of 1. 

- **Number of minutes between options on date-time dropdowns**

   This option allows you to specify how precisely you would like to be able to record minutes in {{work}} and other records. You can choose to be able to record timings exactly to the minute, if it is important to be specific about the amounts of time taken, in 5 minute chunks (so you would only see the options 5,10,15,20 etc. on the drop-down), then in increasing lengths of time – 10,15,20,30 and 60 minute intervals. If you choose 60 minutes, for example, then you would only be able to record the amount of time taken to the nearest hour, and every record would show as starting on the hour.

- **Always add you to the attendance table on {{work}} records?**

   Selecting this option will automatically add you to the attendance table on any {{work}} records you create. Remember this setting is only for your login, so won’t affect the ((work}} records which other people are entering.

- **Show {{staff}} initials attending {{work}} and other records? If so, how many letters of first name/surname to use?**

   Choosing any of the options from this dropdown will add a column to the end of a {{work}} view table called “{{Staff}}” which displays the initials of any {{staff}} member who is recorded as attending. The options allow you to increase or decrease the number of letters displayed for their first name and surname. So for example, if the member of {{staff}} is David Henry, if you choose 1/1, the initials shown in the table column will be DH. If you choose 3/3, it will show DavHen.

- **{{Group}} data view to use by default when viewing […] records**

   When you’re viewing a single {{activity}} record ({{work}}, {{outcome}} or {{referral}}, for example) there is an attendance table included. You can use this series of dropdowns to specify a {{group}} data view which {{Lamplight}} will then use to determine what information will be included in the attendance table columns. This can be useful if you want to see addresses and contact details when viewing a {{work}} record, for instance.
