# 28.3.1 Publishing Module: Publishing Profiles

> With the publishing module you have the opportunity to publish profiles from your {{Lamplight}} database onto a public facing site. By default no profiles are published, and operators can decide to publish individual records



As part of the initial set-up your System Administrator will have specified the type of profiles they are happy for {{Lamplight}} to publish and what information should be published from within them (see section [28.2.0  System Administration - Publishing Module](/help/index/p/28.2.0)). 

Once the System Administrator has decided what can be published, database operators can choose whether to publish specific profiles.

By default, no profiles are published. 

### To Publish a {{Person}} or {{Org}}'s Profile

- Open the profile (see section [5.8.0  Finding {{People}}](/help/index/p/5.8.0) for help with this). 
- Click on the 'Publishing' tab.  
- In this tab you will be able to see:
   - Whether the profile can be published.
   - Whether it is currently published.
   - Whether it can be updated via the Publishing API.

#### Publishing Settings
- You will be able to see at the top of the page whether the profile can be shared or not. 
- If it can be shared, find the field 'Currently published (double click to edit)', and double click over the word 'No' (if it says yes then this profile is already published).
- Tick the box.

- Click 'save'.
- Refresh the page by clicking on the 'Publishing' tab at the top again.
- The profile is now being shared with the public-facing site. 

### Data That's Published
- The publishing tab within the profile displays the information being shared. 
- Any alterations to the information being published will need to be done from within the tab where that data sits usually, with the exception of the 'Publish summary' field, which you can double-click to alter and save.

### To Remove Sharing from a Profile
- In the 'Publishing' tab, find the field 'Currently published (double click to edit)'.
- Double click over the word 'Yes'.
- Untick the box.

These changes will be immediately available on your public-facing site.
