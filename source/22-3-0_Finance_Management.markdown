The system will not allow the same person to claim, authorise, and pay expenses. Different database operators will need to be involved in the process. If you are able to authorise or pay an expense, notification will be given alongside each expense row, stating either yes or no in the table under the heading 'are you able to authorise or pay'?

If you are able to authorise/pay an expense, tick the select box to choose the expense you wish to authorise/pay. As it is selected, the details will be transferred into the second table. You can then click the button to either authorise or pay the expense. The expense status will be updated.

Please note even if you are not able to authorise or pay an expense, you will still be able to select them, but no further action will be possible.

If you wish to search, filter or export the expense details to a spreadsheet, click on the collapse toolbar option to reveal the search options. When the options have been specified, click the 'fetch data' button and the table below will be refreshed.
