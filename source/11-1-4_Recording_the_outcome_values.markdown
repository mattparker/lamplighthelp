# 11.1.4    Recording the {{outcome}} values

> {{Outcome}}s are recorded as yes-no responses, scores, or numbers. Enter as many as you need to. 

The {{outcome}}s that you measure are 'snapshots' at a particular time. These are grouped together into categories to make them easier to manage. The remaining tabs on the screen are the {{outcome}} categories you have set up. On each tab there are the {{outcome}}s you are measuring.

In our example system, these are some of the {{outcome}}s we are measuring:

![Example {{outcome}} categories]({{imgpath}}78a.png)

Under each {{outcome}} there may be some explanatory text in a smaller font.

These {{outcome}}s can either be recorded as:

  * Yes - no (e.g. 'do they have a job')
  * Scores (e.g. 'on a scale of 1-5, how happy are you with your job')
  * Amounts (e.g. 'how many hours/week do you work')

When entering {{outcome}}s you will either see a drop-down box with yes-no options, or if they are expecting scores or amounts, a box into which you type the number.

Once you have entered the actual score or yes/no, you can also add a comment, and whether you (or the {{user}}) feels the any change is a result of your work. The comment can be any text, perhaps an explanation or evidence. The 'our work' tickbox means that you can record changes in the {{person}}s situation, even if they are not the result of your work. This can then be used as a filter when running {{report}}s.

You can enter information for as few or as many {{outcome}}s as you wish to. When you have finished click the 'save' button in the bottom-right.
