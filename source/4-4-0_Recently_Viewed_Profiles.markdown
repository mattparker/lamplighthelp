# 4.4.0 Recently Viewed Profiles

> You can see the ten profiles you have accessed most recently from your home page




If you have the 'Recently viewed profiles' tab on your home page, it will show you the ten profiles that you have accessed most recently. You can click on any of these to jump quickly to a profile you have been working on - to add some more information or look up contact details, for example.
