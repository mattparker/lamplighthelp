# 18.6.1    System Administration - Adding a new database operator


> To find the database operators' table follow the instructions in section [18.6.0  System Administration - Database operators](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.0). From here you can click the 'Add' button below the table. 

A popup window will open requesting the new operator's basic details:

![new database operator]({{imgpath}}150a.png)

Further details about operator roles can be seen in section [18.6.2  System Administration - operator permission levels](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.2).

**Copying personal settings**

You can choose to copy personal settings from another member of staff. You may use personal settings as part of your organisation's process flow, for example with headers on profiles or a particular layout for tables in your system. If so, it may be helpful to  to copy the personal settings from another member of staff to the new user so that their settings match. You can read more about personal settings at: [18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0). 
When you click 'save' to create the new operator, the new password and login details will be emailed to them. The system will also create a profile for that person, setting them as a member of {{staff}}. To view this profile click 'View full details' on the context menu. See section [8.3.0  Profiles](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0) for more about profiles. 

**Password issues**

If the new password does not arrive, then it is most likely to be an issue with the recipient's email spam filter. Most inboxes have a spam folder you can check. If you are using a dummy email address however, or are not able to locate it, you can reset the password.  In the database operators' table, click on the menu to the left the new operator and choose 'Reset password'. This will email a new password, but also displays it in a pop-up box. You can write down the new password or take a screenshot and share it as appropriate.
