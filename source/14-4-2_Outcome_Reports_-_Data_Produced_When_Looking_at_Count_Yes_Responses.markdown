# 14.4.2 {{Outcome}} {{Report}}s - Data Produced When Looking at 'Count Yes Responses'

> If you have an {{outcome}} with yes/no responses, you can choose to count the number of 'yes' responses' given in a specific time period



In {{outcome}}s {{report}}s, you can select 'Count number of yes responses' in the 'How to summarise the data', and you will see a table similar to this:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}}ing - count yes results](134a.png)

The columns in this table show:

- {{Outcome}} - the name of the {{outcome}}.
- Number of 'yes' responses - a count of the total number of 'yes' values entered. If a {{person}} has had more than one reponse recorded in this time, then both with be included in the results. One person with three 'yes' {{outcome}} scores will be counted as 3 in this column.
- Number of 'no' responses - a count of the total number of 'no' values entered. Again, the number of scores are counted, not individuals. One person with three 'no' {{outcome}} scores will be counted as 3 in this column.
- Number of different {{people}} with 'yes' response - a count of 'yes' responses but avoiding 'double-counting' - so one {{person}} with multiple 'yes' responses will only be counted once.
- Number of different {{people}} with 'no' response - as above but for 'no' responses. Each person with a 'no' response will only be counted once, regardless of the number of times they have responded. 
- **One {{person}} with both a 'no' and a 'yes' response will be counted as a 'different person' in both the 'yes' and 'no' columns.**
 - Number of different {{people}} with any response - the total number of {{people}} who have any response at all.
