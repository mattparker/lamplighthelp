# 31.1.0 Overview of the steps to create a {{recruiter}} campaign

> The minimum steps are to create a Question Set for the {{recruiter_applicant}} to complete, 
> ensure equalities monitoring fields are in place, and then create a campaign that
> {{recruiter_applicant}}s respond to.  There are a few other things you should do.



### 1. Check your Job Description and Person Specification

First of all we'd recommend you review your job description and person specification.
You may find this checklist helpful:

 - Does it show the salary (range)? 
 - Does it focus on the capabilities required to do the job?
 - Do you really need the educational qualifications you list? Do you really mean some
particular capability which you assume someone with that qualification has?
 - Do you really need a driving license / car? You can do a lot of work on public transport.
 - What's your approach to flexible / hybrid work? Is it really essential to be in the office?
 - Do you really require experience? What does experience bring? Can you think about the qualities
 you're actually looking for that may come with experience? Might those qualities have been developed
 in other ways?


### 2. Check your language

Lamplight includes a [simple copy-paste language checker](/help/index/p/31.0.1) that will look for words that are 
masculine or feminine coded, or which may be problematic in other ways.  Go to {{people}} >
{{recruiter}} > check language of advert and paste in your text to check.

### 3. Create a Question Set

If this is a new role, or the first time you've carried out capability based applications,
you'll need to create a set of questions that applicants need to complete to apply.  To create
or edit questions, go to admin > system admin > Manage {{recruiter{{ question sets.

The following tips will help as you design your questions:

 - Look at the job description and person specification.  For each capability point, consider
 whether you'll assess it in the application, interview, or both.
 - Think about the sorts of things that the successful candidate will have to do. They should
be in the job description already. Now can you come up with a simplified version of that task
that doesn't need a lot of explanation or background information?  For example, if written skills
are important, you could ask them to write an email in a slightly tricky situation.
 - Aim for open questions. You may want to use select type fields for particular technical skills,
 but most should be text boxes.
 - If it doesn't relate to the job description, don't ask it.
 - Specify the closing date and explain that you'll keep to it. Avoid "rolling applications" or 
"may close early" - this could be discriminatory and is definitely unfair.
 - Don't ask them to do unpaid work for you.  "Suggest a new marketing strategy" probably isn't appropriate.

You can re-use Question Sets for {{recruiter}} campaigns, so if you've recruited for this role
previously, you may want to update the questions rather than create a new set.

You shouldn't edit questions during a campaign.

### 4. Prepare the Mark Scheme

Alongside your Question Set you can create a Mark Scheme, which will give the shortlisting panel
hints about the sorts of things you'd look for in responses.  You can create these at any time
though, you don't have to do it before seeking applicants.

You'll see a link to create the Mark Scheme from the screen where you edit Question Sets


### 5. Setup and check your equalities fields

When creating a campaign you'll probably want some equalities questions.  These are special custom profile
fields which are hidden from the shortlisting panel but can be reported on.  What you ask
will depend on your own policy, but is likely to include protected characteristics.

We recommend that you add separate fields for this, rather than re-using existing demographics fields.

To add or edit fields, go to 'admin > system admin > Manage custom tabs and fields in profiles'.

You only have to do this once, or if you change your equalities monitoring.  Don't edit these fields
mid-way through a campaign, though.

### 6. Create a campaign

A {{Recruiter}} Campaign is your effort to fill a particular role.  It has start and end dates,
a title, a Question Set, equalities questions, explanatory text, and email templates for
successful and unsuccessful candidates.  To create a campaign go to {{people}} > {{recruiter}} > create new campaign..

When you create a campaign Lamplight will generate a unique (and long) URL.  When you go to it
(not while logged in to Lamplight) you'll see contact details, the questions from your Question Set,
and equalities fields.

When {{Recruiter_applicant}}s save an application they'll receive an email with a URL which they
can return to any time until the closing date of the campaign to update their responses.

### 7. Shortlist after the closing date

After the closing date members of the shortlisting panel will need to score the applications you've
received.  You do this from the '{{people}} > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns' screen - there will
be a button on the campaign to allow you to score.

Each member of the panel should score responses separately and independently - you'll see all the scores
later.

Rather than scoring an application, you score all the responses to question 1 all together, with
the Mark Scheme shown alongside.  This allows you to directly compare the responses from different
candidates directly, and helps you score them consistently and fairly.  And your score for question 2
won't be swayed by a particularly strong or weak response to question 1.

The order the responses are displayed in is randomised each time you view the responses.  So you can't link
responses.  The first response you see while scoring question 1 probably isn't from the same
application as the first response to question 2.

You can save your scores and return to any of them at any time, but we'd strongly recommend you
score all responses to a particular question in one go, so that you are comparing all responses
to each other.

### 8. Decision making

Once all members of the panel have scored all the responses, you'll be able to see the scores
and make final decisions about each application.   You do this from the '{{people}} > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns'
screen.

We recommend that the panel do this together, either in person or over a video call.  The table
of scores shows total scores for each application, in score order.  You can also see scores for each
question and where different panel members scored differently.

Until you finalise the decision you won't be able to see individual profile information, but at this
stage you can view separate applications altogether.  You can enter reasons here, which can be included
as feedback to candidates (if you've set up your email templates to include this).

### 9. Contacting candidates

Once final decisions have been made you can use Lamplight to email candidates using the templates
 you set up in the campaign.  Templates can include mail merge fields, and can also include 
feedback from the panel saved when you made the final decisions.  The template for successful candidates
should include possible times for interview.  

We recommend offering all candidates a range of dates and times, and asking them to respond 
with their preferred times.

### 10. Interviews

From this point the process management leaves Lamplight, although you could use the {{comm}}s module
and templates to make it easier.  The process and communications typically become more personalised and there's less
need for a system.
