# 52.2.2 How to Filter Records

> If you are viewing records in a profile or through the main menu bar, it is possible to filter them so that you can focus on the ones that you want to see. You can also add in some extra columns of information through the ‘Search’ bar



This video gives and introduction to the 'search' bar which you can find above some tables in {{Lamplight}}. It helps you to narrow down your search for records by information found in the records, such as {{workarea}} or date.
