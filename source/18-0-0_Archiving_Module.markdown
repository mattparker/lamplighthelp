# 18.0.0 Archiving Module

> If you have multiple {{projects}} and are closing one down, it is possible to keep the data with us in case you need it in future

Usually, when closing a {{project}} an organisation will take all the information they need from it in the form of tables, then the {{project}} will be shut and deleted from the system. If you use the archiving module, although you have no day-to-day access to your data, it is not deleted and can be restored at any time.

If you restore a {{project}}, the usual charges for a core system (and any extra modules) will apply.
