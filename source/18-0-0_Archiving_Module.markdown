# 18.0.0 Archiving Data

> If you have multiple {{project}}s and are closing one down, it is possible to keep the data with us in case you need it in future



<<<<<<< HEAD
Usually, when closing a {{project}} an organisation will take all the information they need from it in the [form of tables and an SQL backup](/help/index/p/16.15.1) of the system. The {{project}} will then be shut and deleted from the system. If you use the Archiving Module, although you have no day-to-day access to your data, the data is not deleted and can be restored at any time. You are also able to access it for three days each month.

If you restore a {{project}}, the usual hosting fee for a core system (and any extra modules) will apply.

Please contact Lamplight if you'd like to use the Archiving Module for one of your projects.  There is a small monthly charge to cover the cost of hosting and backups the data.
