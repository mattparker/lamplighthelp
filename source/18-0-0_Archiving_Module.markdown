# 18.0.0 Archiving Module

> If you have multiple {{project}}s and are closing one down, it is possible to keep the data with us in case you need it in future



Usually, when closing a {{project}} an organisation will take all the information they need from it in the form of tables and an SQL backup of the system. The {{project}} will then be shut and deleted from the system. If you use the Archiving Module, although you have no day-to-day access to your data, it is not deleted and can be restored at any time. You are also able to access it for three days each month.

If you restore a {{project}}, the usual hosting fee for a core system (and any extra modules) will apply.
