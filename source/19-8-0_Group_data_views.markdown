# 19.8.0    {{Group}} data views

> {{Group}} data views are an entirely new feature in version 3. A {{group}} is just a list of {{people}}. {{Group}} data views let you view different sets of information about these {{people}} on one screen. 

Perhaps you're doing some follow up from a training course run 3 months ago. Set up the {{auto group}} to find the people that attended. Then set up a {{group}} view with contact details, and work your way through them. 

Or you may want to do your own analysis of the demographics of your {{user}}s. Set up the {{group}} data view with the fields you need, and download the results into a spreadsheet, and off you go.

You can use any {{group}} data view with any {{group}}.
