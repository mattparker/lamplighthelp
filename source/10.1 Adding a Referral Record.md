# 10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record

**You can add {{referral}} records from the top menu or directly from a {{person}}’s profile in the ‘{{Referral}}s’ tab. The process is the same from either place.**

**To create a {{referral}} from the top menu:**

1. Click on Activity on the main menu
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 1](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_1.png)

2. In the ‘{{Referral}}’ box click New {{Referral}}
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 2](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_2.png)

**To create a {{referral}} from a profile:**

1. Find the profile you wish to add a {{referral}} for. See [4.1 Using the Search Function](/help/index/p/4.1) for more information.

2. Click on the {{Referral}} tab
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - to a profile](10.1_add_referrals_profile.png)

Whichever of these ways you choose, a new record will open in a pop-up window.  

The first tab that you come to when creating a referral record is the 'When and where' tab.

**When and where tab**

1. Edit the ‘Time and date of record’ box to show the correct details, either by clicking on the calendar icon or by adding them manually
- {{Lamplight}} will automatically complete these for you with the time and date that you create the record. You need to change these so that they show the actual time and date of the {{referral}}.
- If the actual time of day does not matter, then you can leave this field as it is.
- This information can be used for reporting, for example to calculate the number of {{referral}}s in a specific time period.

2. Choose the {{Work}} Area, based on your own options
- The {{workarea}} is a required field, so you will need to fill one in on every record.
- You can only choose one {{workarea}}, and once you have done this a {{subworkarea}} menu will pop out.
- You can choose as many of these as you like.
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 4](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_4.png)

3. Add any Sub-{{Work}} Areas that apply
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 5](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_5.png)

4. Locations
- If they have been set up, you will see a list of locations below the {{workarea}}s.
- You can select one of these if it is relevant to your {{referral}}/organisation.

**Attendance/Involving tab**

There are two different ways this tab may be displayed.

**Attendance**

If the tab on your referral record shows as 'Attendance', you can include as many profiles as you would like in the table. As well as users, this can include organisations, staff, or others - anyone with a profile in the system. The table looks like this:
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - attendance](10.1_add_referral_attendance.png)

1. Start typing in the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} who made the {{referral}} into the search box above the table on the Attendance tab. Lamplight will make suggestions on which profile you want. When you see the correct one, click on it and it will be added to the record
![10.1_add_referral_att_search](10.1_add_referral_att_search.png)
![10.1_add_referral_att_search2](10.1_add_referral_att_search2.png)

**Altering Role and Attendance Type**

To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person (e.g. from 'Attended' to 'For reference', for example):

- Click on the table cell where that information is showing.
- A drop-down box will appear.
- Select the appropriate option. These options are customised for your system, and your system administrator can add options to them as necessary.

**Adding Notes**

There is also the option to add any further notes {{safeguarding case}}ing the attendees. Click in the notes box along from their name
to add further detail.

**Removing Someone from the Table**

To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This
will check and then remove them from the table (not the database).

**Unknown Attendees**

Although it's unlikely to be relevant in {{referral}}s, you can also add the number of {{people}} that attended who are
unknown to you: a large public event, for example. Just add the number of people in the final field 'Number of unknown
attendees'.

**Involving**

The tab in your system may be called 'Involving' rather than 'Attendance'. It is still used to record who was involved in the referral, but is simplified. (Whether it's 'Involving' or 'Attendance' depends on the global settings your system administrator has set.)

On this page you will see three search boxes - one for the 'referrer', one for the person who was referred, and the last for who they were referred to. The tab looks like this:
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - involving](10.1_add_referral_involving.png)

1. Start typing in the name of the {{person}} or {{org}} who made the {{referral}} into the ‘Who is the {{referral}} from?’ box. Lamplight will make suggestions on which profile you want. When you see the correct one, click on it and it will be added to the record
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 7](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_7.png)

![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 8](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_8.png)

2. Use “Who was referred?” box to add the name of the {{user}} being referred, and the ‘Who were they referred to?’ if needed to include where they were referred on to.
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 9](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_9.png)


**Attendance roles**

In the case of {{referral}}s, there are additional roles that may be relevant and can be useful when running
{{report}}s. These are:

- 'Referrer' (who made the {{referral}}).
- 'Referred to' (the member of {{staff}} who accepted the {{referral}}).
- 'Service {{user}} referred' (the actual {{person}} that was referred).


**Details tab**

1. Click on the ‘Details’ tab at the top or click ‘Next’ at the bottom right of the record window to move on to the next page
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 10](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_10.png)

2. Choose the correct ‘{{Referral}} direction’ in the drop-down box. What you see here will vary according to your {{org}}’s options, or you may not see this box at all.
This is where you can record whether it is a {{referral}} out of your organisation, or if you are receiving a {{referral}} in. You may also be able to show other types of referral, depending on the options in the drop-down list. This can be customised by your System Administrator.
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 11](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_11.png)

3. You can set whether the {{referral}} was successful or not in the ‘{{Referral}} success’ drop-down
![10.1 Adding a {{Referral}} Record - step 12](10.1_Adding_a_Referral_Record_im_12.png)

4. Click into the ‘{{Referral}} Reason box’ to add any details you want for this {{referral}}
- The '{{Referral}} reason' is like the headline, and is what will appear in a {{referral}}s table to give you a quick idea of what it is about. 
- The '{{Referral}} notes' is a place to record any other details that you will need to keep.
![10.1_add_referral_reason_and_notes](10.1_add_referral_reason_and_notes.png)

5. If you have the {{Waiting list}} Module enabled, you will also see a drop-down listing all the current {{waiting list}}s. Select one to add the '{{user}} referred' to the {{waiting list}} from within this {{referral}} record.  

6. Click ‘Save’ at the bottom of the page to save the {{referral}}
