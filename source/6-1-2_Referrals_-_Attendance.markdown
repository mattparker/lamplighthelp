# 6.1.2 {{Referral}}s: Attendance

> The attendance tab is a place to record details of the {{people}} and {{org}}s involved in the {{referral}} 


There are two different ways this tab may be displayed.

### Attendance

If the tab on your {{referral}} record shows as 'Attendance', you can include as many people as you would like in the table. As well as {{user}}s, this can include {{org}}s, {{staff}}, or others - anyone with a profile in the system. /the table looks like this:

**Adding Attendees**

To add additional attendees:
- Start typing their name in the 'search' box. 
- When you have typed at least three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing potential matches. 
- If you do not see the name that you are looking for, keep typing until it appears in the list. 
- Click on the name that you want, and they will be added to the table.

**Altering Role and Attendance Type**

To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person (e.g. from 'Attended' to 'For reference', for example):
- Click on the table cell where that information is showing. 
- A drop-down box will appear. 
- Select the appropriate option. These options are customised for your system, and your system administrator can add options to them as necessary (see section [16.6.0  System Administration - Lists](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/16.6.0)).

In the case of {{referral}}s, there are additional roles that may be relevant and can be useful when running {{report}}s. These are: 
- 'Referrer' (who made the {{referral}}).
- 'Referred to' (the member of {{staff}} who accepted the {{referral}}). 
- 'Service {{user}} referred' (the actual {{person}}that was referred). 

**Adding Notes**

There is also the option to add any further notes concerning the attendees. Click in the notes box along from their name to add further detail. 

**Removing Someone from the Table**

To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This will check and then remove them from the table (not the database). 

**Unknown Attendees**

Although it's unlikely to be relevant in {{referral}}s, you can also add the number of {{people}} that attended who are unknown to you: a large public event, for example. Just add the number of people in the final field 'Number of unknown attendees'. 

### Involving

The tab in your system may be called 'Involving' rather than 'Attendance'. It is still used to record who was involved in the {{referral}}, but is simplified. 

On this page you will see three search boxes - one for the 'referrer', one for the {{person}} who was referred, and the last for who they were referred to.

To add a {{person}} to any of these roles:
- Start typing their name in the relevant search box. 
- Once you have typed three letters, {{Lamplight}} will start to predict the name of the {{person}} that you are looking for. 
- Once you see them in the list click on their name, and they will be added to the search box. 
- You can only add one {{person}} or {{org}} per role. 
- If they do not appear in the list to pick from, check that they have their own profile on the system. 

You can see this in action on our video, 'Creating a Referral'.
