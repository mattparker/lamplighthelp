# 17.6.2    Logged {{comm}}s {{report}}

> From the main menu select {{report}}s -> {{comm}}s {{report}}. 

A similar process to create a logged {{comm}} {{report}} is taken to that shown in section [17.6.1  Sent {{comm}}s {{report}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.6.1) However you do have the ability to filter the {{report}} by {{workarea}}. Click on the downwards arrow to open up your selection of {{workarea}}s and choose the appropriate area.
