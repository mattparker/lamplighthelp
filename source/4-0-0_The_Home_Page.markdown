# 4.0.0 The Home Page

> The home page is the first page you see after logging in, and can be reached by clicking 'home' on the main menu at any time



You can customise the tabs that appear on your home page (without affecting other system operators) in System Administration - see section [16.4.1  Personal Settings - Logging In and General Settings](/help/index/p/16.4.1) for more information. 

There is more information on this in our video, 'Introduction and Main Menu'.
