# 12.1.2  <i class="fa fa-users"></i> {{Auto group}}s: {{User}}, {{Staff}} and Other Custom Fields

> All the filters relating to the personal information for the {{people}} and {{org}}s in your system, for example demographic information, are held in tabs called by the name of the role, for example {{User}} or {{Staff}} fields



### '{{User}} Fields', '{{Staff}} Fields', '{{Funder}} Fields' Etc

These tabs contain the filters relating to the information in the profiles of your {{user}}s, {{staff}}, and {{funder}}s respectively. The fields for {{work}} and other {{activity}} records are held in separate tabs.

- The choices here will depend on what is in your individual system, but may include such things as demographic information.  
- They may not be visible at all if {{Lamplight}} has no custom fields set up. 

#### Things to Remember When Filtering

Date fields:

  - On or after: the date you specify will be included.
  - On or before: the date you specify will be included.
  - On: only those that match this date will be included.
  - Between: people who have a number or date recorded on or between the two that you specify will be included.

Multi-select fields:

![Multi-select List](11.1.2b.png)

  - 'Does have': people who do have an exact match to all the options that you select will be included. 
  - 'Does not have': people who do not have any of the options that you select will be included.
  - 'Has at least one of': people who have at least one (maybe more) of the options that you select will be included.
  - 'Has at least two of': people with at least two (maybe more) of the options that you select will be included.
  - 'Has at least three of': people who have at least three of the options that you choose will be included.
  
Depending on how your system is set up, these can let you do things like {{auto group}}s of "people who do not receive Income Support", or "people with multiple health conditions".
