#    9.3.0 Creating a New Record in a {{Linked Case}}

> It is possible to create a {{work}} or other {{activity}} record directly in a {{linked case}}, so that you do not have to link it later

If you use {{linked case}}s as part of your process, and know what {{linked case}} a record needs to go in when you are adding it to the system, you can add a new record from within that {{linked case}}.

To do this:

- Go to the '{{Linked case}} view' tab in the {{person}} or {{org}}'s profile.
- Find the {{linked case}} that you want to add the record to from the boxes on the left-hand side of the screen. 
- Click on this box to open up the {{linked case}}.
- At the top of the screen, under 'Add new record to {{linked case}}, click on the record type that you are adding ({{work}}, {{referral}}, {{outcome}} etc.

- If you have the {{Eval}}s Module and are adding an {{eval}}, please also select the type of {{eval}} from the drop-down box at this stage.

- This will open up a new record where you will add detail. For information on how to complete the record, please see the relevant section in these help pages.
- When you have finished, click save. The record will be saved and automatically added to the {{linked case}} chosen at the start.
