# 10.1.0 Creating a {{Comm}}

> You can create a {{comm}} from the main menu in {{Lamplight}}. This could be an email, letter or mailing labels 

### Creating a {{Comm}}

To create a {{comm}} from the main menu:
- Go to {{Work}} -> {{comm}} -> create on the main menu. 
- You will see the main screen for creating {{comm}}s:

**{{Comm}} Type**

- Choose the type of {{comm}} you want to send. Depending on your settings, you may also have a date and time and {{workarea}} to fill in on this screen.
  - If you have the {{Comm}}s Module, you will see a text box to give a short desription of this {{comm}}. 
 
 **Recipients**
 
 - Add anyone this will be sent to in the 'Recipients' tab. You can do this using the 'search' box at the top to look for individuals or {{group}}s. 
 - The 'Mail merge options' section refers to linked profiles. These are not switched on in all systems, but if they are in yours you will see names linked to other names when you type in the search box. For example, you might see 'David Henry, Beaufort Community Centre'. This means that the 'Beaufort Community Centre' is linked to 'David Henry'.   
- If you use linked profiles in {{Lamplight}}, the 'Mail-merge options' let you decide whose address details you are going to use to send the {{comm}} to. For example, if you want to send a letter to David Henry, but have it delivered to his work address at Beaufort Community Centre, add the linked profile to the attendance list and choose to use the address details of the 'second profile listed'.
- If this is not possible for some reason (i.e. the contact details for the linked profile are not in the system), then {{Lamplight}} will revert to using the person's own contact details. It will always check permissions before sending. 

**Email Details**

- This is where you enter the subject line which will go in an email, and you can set the address that you want replies to be sent to. 
- Choose whether you would like each person to get a separate email, if you want to copy each recipient in to the same email (cc), or if you would like to send the same email but blind copy each recipient in so that they can't see who else is included (bcc). 
- If you want to use mailmerge details when you set up your message content (see below), then you will need to choose the 'Separate personalised email' option. 

**Files**

- If you have any files to attach to the {{comm}}, you can upload them here.

**Mailing Labels**

- If you are creating mailing labels, you can choose the size of the label from the drop-down list in this tab.

**Message Content**

- If you are creating mailing labels, you’ll see a mail-merge address block is already present in the text box.  You can edit this if you choose, but don’t need to do anything else.
- For letters and emails you can click on the + in the top right of the text box, which will reveal the rich text editing tools.

![The Text Formatting Tools](10.1.0a.png)

- You can copy and paste into the text box. We recommend pasting the text into Notebook first to make sure that any existing html formatting is removed.
- If you have chosen to send a separate letter or email to each person, you can use the ‘People Mail Merge’ drop-down.  It contains a number of fields which you can add so that your message autofills information. Choose them from the drop-down list and use them in your text as you would actual content. For example, I can write ‘Dear {{space}}, select ‘first name’ from the dropdown list before moving to the next line.  When merged, ‘First name’ will be replaced by the name of each person you send your email to.

### Testing and Sending

![Saving, testing or creating a {{comm}}](83c.png)

- Once you've completed your {{comm}}, click 'Create/Send'.
    - If you have created letters or mailing labels they will either open directly in Word for you to print out, or appear in a download box at the bottom of your screen. Click on this to open it. 
    - If you have created email, this will send it directly from your account. (Please note, you will need to have set up your email settings in the system admin section for this to work. For more information on this, please see [16.11.0 Setting Up Email](/help/index/p/16.11.0)).
-The ‘Save but do not send’ button only works if you have the {{Comm}}s Module.
- The ‘Test’ button will appear if your {{comm}} is an email. It will send a copy to your own email address for you to check.  Stay on this page while you look at it so that you can make any amendments before sending.
- Please note, if you do not have the {{Comm}}s Module your {{comm}} will not be saved in the system. For more on the module, please see [21.0.0 The {{Comm}}s Module](/help/index/p/21.0.0).
