3. For security reasons you will need to enter your current username (email address) and password, and your new password.
If your {{org}} has set up its own policy on what combination of letters, numbers and symbols passwords must contain, you will see this below the password-changing boxes. If this is not the {{linked case}}, passwords need to be between 8 and 20 characters long and consist of letters and numbers.
Save the new password once you&#039;ve finished. You will receive on-screen confirmation that your password has been changed.

2. Enter your user name and the security text
Follow the instructions and a new password will be sent to the email address that you use to log in to your account.
Log in again using the new password. If you are cutting and pasting it from an email, make sure not to copy any spaces either side of the password, as these will cause your login to fail.
On the next screen you will be prompted to change to a new password. If your {{org}} has a password policy, that will be shown at the bottom of the screen. If there is no policy, then your password will need to be between 6 and 20 characters long and consist of letters and numbers.
