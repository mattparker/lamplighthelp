#  16.5.4 Deleting a Database Operator

> It is important to delete members of staff as database operators when they leave

When a database operator leaves your organisation it is important to remove their access to the system so that they cannot continue to see the data stored there. Doing this **does not** delete their profile or any of the records that they have entered or are involved in. It simply means that they can no longer log in to the system. 

- On the database operator table, use the menu button or right click on the name of the database operator.
- Select delete.
