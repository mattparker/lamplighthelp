# 14.4.3  <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> {{Outcome}} {{Report}}s - Data Produced When Looking at a'Snapshot'

> A 'snapshot' gives you a chance to see average scores for the dates you are looking at rather than comparing them to see change over time



If you select 'Snapshot - view actual scores, not change' in the 'How to summarise the data' section of '{{Report}} presentation', you will see a table similar to this:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}} - snapshot results](135a.png)

The columns in this table show:

- {{Outcome}}: the name of the particular {{outcome}} measure.
- Average score: the average (mean) of all scores included in this {{report}}.
- Number of people w. scores: the number of unique individuals whose scores are included in the {{report}}.
- Max score: the maximum score recorded for this measure in the specified timescale.
- Min score: the minimum score recorded for this measure in the given timescale.
- Standard deviation of score: an indication of the 'spread' of scores. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average. A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out.
- Sum of scores: the total of all the scores recorded for this measure between the dates given.
