# 24.6.1    {{Project}} sharing - setting up policies

> The system administrator will need to set up {{project}} sharing policies that determine what information is shared between {{project}}s. 

To set up {{project}} sharing policies, go to Admin -> system administration -> {{Project}} sharing {{work}} etc policies (or {{project}} sharing: {{people}} policies). The process is very similar for {{work}} and {{people}} policies. For an overview of {{project}} sharing see section [24.6.0  {{Project}} sharing](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.6.0).

As with other lists in {{Lamplight}} you'll see current policies and the option to add a new policy:

![Manage sharing policies]({{imgpath}}233a.png)

To add a new one, double-click your mouse over the 'double click to add' label and enter the name of the new policy. This is what will appear in the drop-down lists that database operators will see, so you'll need to make sure the names are clear. When you have done that, press 'enter' on your keyboard to save the policy name.

You now need to click on the 'add policy details link' that is shown below the policy name. A popup window will appear:

![Setting {{project}} sharing policy details]({{imgpath}}233b.png)

You now need to set the various options that define this policy:

  1. What can database operators in other {{project}}s do with the data you're sharing?
  2. Who are you sharing with - based on access role and {{project}}

You can also make policies available in all {{project}}s, or just the current one, using the final check box. Click 'save' when you're done. This policy is now available for use.

If you edit an existing policy, all records previously shared using that policy will be updated. So if you change the {{project}}s that a policy applies to, all old records that you've shared will reflect the changes you have made. If you do not want this, delete the policy and create a new one.
