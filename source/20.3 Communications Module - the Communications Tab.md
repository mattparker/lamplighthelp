- View {{activity}}: opens the details of the {{comm}} including any attached files
- Edit {{comm}}: opens the data entry window where you can change the details
- New {{comm}} to profiles on {{activity}}: allows you to add a {{comm}} record for the profiles attached to this record
- Link to {{linked case}}: allows you to link this {{comm}} record to a {{linked case}} (if you use {{linked case}}s)
- Archive {{activity}}: archives the {{comm}}. You can still see it if you click on the 'Filter' button in the search bar above the {{comm}}s table, then select 'Show archived records'.

If you are using {{linked case}}s in your system, you will also see the following options:

- Link to {{linked case}}: allows you to add this {{comm}} to a {{linked case}}. (See section [14 {{Linked case}}s - Opening, Closing and Linking Records](/help/index/p/14) for more.)
- Remove link to {{linked case}}: if a {{comm}} is already attached to a {{linked case}}, this option will remove again. It will not delete the record.
- Close {{linked case}}: flags the {{linked case}} which the record is attached to as closed.
- Re-open {{linked case}}: will re-open a {{linked case}} which the record is attached to if it has previously been closed. If the {{linked case}} is still open, this option will be greyed out.
- View {{linked case}} details: takes you to a screen to see the details of the {{linked case}}.
- Edit {{linked case}}: allows you to edit the details of the {{linked case}} rather than the record.

**Creating and Logging {{Comm}}s**

You can also create or log a new {{comm}} for the {{person}} or {{org}} whose profile you are in by clicking the 'Create {{comm}}' or 'Log {{comm}}' buttons in the top or bottom right hand corner (see sections [17 {{Comm}} - Creating and Editing](/help/index/p/17) and [20 {{Comm}}s Module - Creating, Logging and Viewing {{Comm}}s](/help/index/p/20) for more).
