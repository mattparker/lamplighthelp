- Choose the type of record you wish to create. 
- The process from here is the same as for setting up any new {{work}} record (for more details see [7.1.0  Adding a {{Work}} Record](/help/index/p/7.1.0).

### Changing the Time and Date of a {{Work}} Record

Once {{work}} records have been created, the appointment time and date can be altered. 
- Click on the relevant record in the diary. 
- Hold down the mouse button and drag the record to the new appointment time.

### Editing a {{Work}} Record in the Diary

Left-clicking on a {{work}} record in the diary brings up a context menu.

- **View full details**. This will open up the record so that you can see all the information recorded in it on one page.
- **Edit**. If you click this option you will be able to open the record up to edit it. If this is one of a series of recurring records, hover your mouse over the word 'Edit', and you will also see the option to edit 'all recurring records in the series'.
- **Add me as attending staff**. If you click this option, you will be added to the attendance table of the {{work}} record with an attendance type of 'Attended' and a role of {{staff}}. If you are already on the attendance table, then clicking this option will not make any change. 
- **Delete**. Managers and System Administrators can permanently delete records from the system.
- **Duplicate record**. This will create a duplicate of the {{work}} record, which will appear in the diary on the same day and time. You can then click on the new record to edit it. 
- **Add {{outcome}}s**. This will open up an {{outcome}} record for everyone included in the attendance table. For more on adding {{outcome}} records, see [8.1.0 Adding {{Outcome}}s from the Main Menu Bar](/help/index/p/8.1.0).
