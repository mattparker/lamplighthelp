# 16.5.2    System Administration - Adding a New Database Operator


> System Administrators can add new database operators to their system in the Database Operators' table

**Please note: When you add a new database operator to the system, it will automatically create a new staff profile for them. If already have a profile on the system it will be necessary to merge the two (see p. 13). When you do this, make sure that the profile you keep is the new database operator one.**

To add new operator:

- Click 'admin' on the menu bar, then 'system administration'.
- Under the 'Manage database operators' heading, click 'Add, edit and remove database operators'.
- Right click in the table or use the menu button and select 'Add new' from the pop-up menu. Alternatively you can use the 'click here' button below the table.



A popup window will open requesting the new operator's basic details:

- Complete the form. Please note that the email address will be their log-in.
- You can choose to copy personal settings for the new operator from another member of staff. You may use personal settings as part of your organisation's process flow, for example with headers on profiles or a particular layout for tables in your system. If so, copying the personal settings from another member of staff will make sure that their settings match. You can read more about personal settings at: [18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/p/18.12.0). 
- Click to save.
- When you add a new database operator to the system, it will automatically create a new staff profile and send an automatically generated email to their registered email account with their initial password.

Further details about operator roles can be seen in section [18.6.2  System Administration - operator permission levels](/help/index/p/18.6.2).


**Password issues**

If the new password does not arrive, then it is most likely to be an issue with the recipient's email spam filter. Most inboxes have a spam folder you can check. If you are using a dummy email address however, or are not able to locate it, you can reset the password.  In the database operators' table, click on the menu to the left the new operator (you can also bring this menu up by right clicking on the relevant row in the table) and choose 'Reset password'. This will email a new password, but also displays it in a pop-up box. You can write down the new password or take a screenshot and share it as appropriate.
