# 32.1.0 Starting to create a new Report CodeSet

> To create a new Report CodeSet, a system administrator needs to go to admin > system admin > 
> 'View and edit Report CodeSets' in the modules section.

Below the explanatory text is a 'Create a new CodeSet' button. Click this and you will be prompted to give your new
CodeSet a name and description.

The name appears in drop-downs within the system; the description is for your reference.  Enter both and click 'save'.

When you do so, you will then see a new option to select the field you wish to create a Map for.  Please see the 
next pages in the manual that explain the types of field you can use, and the types of Map available.


Once you have created your CodeSet by saving the name and description, you can return to edit it through the admin
main menu.  Existing CodeSets will be listed and you can edit or delete them.
