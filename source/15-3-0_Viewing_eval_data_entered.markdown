# 15.3.0    Viewing {{eval}} data entered

> To view {{eval}}s entered, go to {{Work}}-> View all-> {{Eval}}s on the main menu. 

To view {{eval}}s entered, go to {{Work}}-> View all-> {{Eval}}s on the main menu. A list of completed {{eval}}s will be shown. This screen is very similar to viewing {{work}} records or {{outcome}}s: see section [9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.0) for more information.

If you have added {{people}} in the 'attendance' tab while entering the {{eval}} answers, you can also view the {{eval}}s they have completed in the '{{eval}}s' tab on their profile.
