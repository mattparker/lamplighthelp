# 5.8.0    Finding {{People}}

> Use the search bar on the top right-hand corner of your screen to find a profile quickly

There are a number of ways to find a particular {{person}} or {{org}}. The easiest way is to use the search bar in the top-right corner of your screen. 

![Search Bar](5.8.0b.png)


- Type in the search bar and the system will search the database for profiles with similar names (the search only starts after you've typed 3 letters).  
- As the system finds matches, you will see a drop-down list:

- As you continue typing the system will keep searching, so if you don't see the {{person}} you're searching for initially, keep typing.
- Click on the name you want to view their profile.  
- You can also search by the id number of the {{person}}, by email address or by date fields if you have set any up:
  - If searching by ID number, you will need to make sure it is at least 3 digits long. You may need to add zeros to the start of the number (e.g. to find {{person}} 23, type 023 in the search bar.) You can find a person's ID number by hovering over the text 'Profile for' at the top of their profile page.

  - Email addresses need to be entered in full before the search will begin.
  - Dates should be entered in the format dd/mm/yyyy.


You can also search the entire system by clicking the 'Go' button - see section [3.2.0 Search Bar](/help/index/p/3.2.0).
