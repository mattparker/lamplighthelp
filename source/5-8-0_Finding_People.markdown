# 5.8.0    Finding {{People}}

> Use the search bar on the top right-hand corner of your screen to find a profile quickly



There are a number of ways to find a particular {{person}} or {{org}}. The easiest way is to use the search bar in the top-right corner of your screen. 

![Search Bar](5.8.0b.png)


- Type in the search bar and the system will search the database for profiles with similar names (the search only starts after you've typed 3 letters).  
- As the system finds matches, you will see a drop-down list:

![Search as you type drop- down](42a.png)

- As you continue typing the system will keep searching, so if you don't see the {{person}} you're searching for initially, keep typing.
- Click on the name you want to view their profile.  

You can also search other fields, depending on what you type in:

  - Email address - it needs to be entered in full before the search will begin.
  - Dates should be entered in the format dd/mm/yyyy, and custom date fields (e.g. 'date of birth') will be searched.
  - Postcode, phone and mobile phone numbers
- ID number - if you enter a number, Lamplight will search by the ID number of the {{person}}.  If searching by ID number, you will need to make sure it is at least 3 digits long. You may need to add zeros to the start of the number (e.g. to find {{person}} 23, type 023 in the search bar). Lamplight will also search for {{activity}} and {{linked case}} records with the same ID number.  You can find a person's ID number by hovering over the text 'Profile for' at the top of their profile page.

You can also search the entire system by clicking the 'Go' button - see section [3.2.0 Search Bar](/help/index/p/3.2.0).
