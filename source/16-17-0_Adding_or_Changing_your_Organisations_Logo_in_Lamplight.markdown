# 16.17.0 Adding or Changing your Organisation's Logo in {{Lamplight}}

> You can add your organisation's logo to the top of your {{Lamplight}} screen, or change an existing one if your branding is updated



You can add your organisation's logo or change it at any time. To do this you will need a picture which is 250 px wide, and 80 px high.

- Go to 'admin -> system administration -> Customise Lamplight -> Add or change your organisation logo'.
- Give the logo a name, and select which {{project}}s it will be used for (if you use {{project}}s in {{Lamplight}}).
- Click on the 'Browse' button to find nd select the picture file.
- Click the 'save' button at the bottom of the page. 

If you find that you can only see part of your logo, this is because the image you have uploaded is too large. You will need to resize it and then reupload.
