# 16.13.0 Uploading Profile Data to {{Lamplight}}

> Profile information can be uploaded in bulk to {{Lamplight}}. It will need to be prepared so that it is in the correct format first

In {{Lamplight}} we identify two different types of information - information you hold about people and information you hold about the activities that you do with them. 

System administrators can import information about people and {{org}}s using and Excel spreadsheet. Information about the activities is more complex, and will need to be imported by Lamplight.
