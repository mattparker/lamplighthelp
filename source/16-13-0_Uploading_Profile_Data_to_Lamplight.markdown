# 16.13.0 <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i>  Uploading Profile Data to {{Lamplight}}

> Profile information can be uploaded in bulk to {{Lamplight}}. It will need to be prepared so that it is in the correct format first



In {{Lamplight}} we identify two different types of information - information you hold about people and information you hold about the activities that you do with them. 

System Administrators can import information about {{people}} and {{org}}s using an Excel spreadsheet. Information about the activities is more complex, and will need to be imported by Lamplight (please contact us at [hello@lamplightdb.co.uk](mailto:hello@lamplightdb.co.uk) if you need more information).
