# 60.1.0 Adding {{Grant}} Records

> As with {{work}} and {{referral}} records, a {{grant}} record can either be added through a profile or by opening a new record via the main menu bar

There are two places that you can open a new record from. 
- If your {{grant}} record relates to a single {{org}} or person, it is easiest to open their profile in {{Lamplight}}, click on the  '{{Grant}}s' tab to open it, then click 'Add' on the right-hand side of that page. 
- You can also open a new record by choosing 'activity -> add new -> {{grant}}' from the main menu.

Once you have a new record, there are 3 tabs which you need to complete.

### When and Where

- Fill in the time and date of this grant. The time and date from and to may well be the same as each other, or you may want to use these to log the beginning and end of an application process.
- You will need to log the {{workarea}} that this {{grant}} relates to. 

### Attendance

- Use the search bar to find the {{person}} or {{org}} associated with the {{grant}}. Depending on the way that you are using your records, this would be the donor (if it is being given to you) or recipient (if they are used to log donations given by you).

### Details

- At the top of the page, choose the '{{Grant}} type' from the drop-down list. Your System Administrator can add to this list and amend it as necessary - see [16.6.0 System Administration: Lists](/help/index/p/16.6.0) for more information.
- The next field is to record the approval date of the {{grant}}, if there is one.
- Under that, enter the amount concerned.
- The {{grant}} summary, description and Monitoring requirements are all free text boxes where you can enter more detail about the {{grant}} for future reference.

You may also see some other tabs on your record. These could be custom tabs, set up to capture information relevant to your organisation, or they could relate to modules that you have in your system. These work in the same way as they do for other record types.
