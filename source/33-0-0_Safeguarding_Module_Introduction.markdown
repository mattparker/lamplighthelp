# 33.0.0 {{Safeguarding}} Module

> The {{safeguarding}} module helps you to manage safeguarding {{safeguarding case}}s in your organisation. The module gives managers oversight of {{safeguarding case}}s, and allows {{safeguarding lead contact}}s to fully document their work when {{safeguarding case}}s are raised.

The module provides a structure and approach that aligns with current best practice. It provides internal
confidentiality while enabling access to those that need it, and some measure of feedback to team members.

Any operator may raise a {{safeguarding case}} about someone. Safeguarding Managers are notified, review the {{safeguarding case}}, and assign a
{{safeguarding lead contact}} to the case. The {{safeguarding lead contact}} adds details to the case as it proceeds, sharing limited information with
other team members as appropriate. At the resolution of the case a final report can be recorded and the case signed off
by a manager. These can then be reviewed to support organisational improvements where necessary.

Almost all data is write once, and all changes are logged within the case itself, so a full audit trail and journey of
the investigation is available. Once saved, records can only be commented on further. This protects the integrity of the
investigation record.

A dashboard view allows safeguarding managers to see an overview of the status of all investigations to ensure that
{{safeguarding case}}s are progressed promptly. Reports provide more detailed statistical breakdowns of {{safeguarding case}}s raised.

As well as managing safeguarding {{safeguarding case}}s, the module also allows you to record DBS check results and prompts when
renewals become due.
