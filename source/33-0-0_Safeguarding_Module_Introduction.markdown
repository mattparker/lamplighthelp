# 33.0.0 {{Safeguarding}} Module

> The {{safeguarding}} module helps you to manage {{safeguarding case}}s in your organisation. The module gives managers oversight of {{safeguarding case}}s, and allows {{safeguarding lead contact}}s to fully document their work when {{safeguarding case}}s are raised.

The module provides a structure and approach to support your good practice in managing {{safeguarding}}. It provides internal
confidentiality while enabling access to those that need it, and some measure of feedback to team members. Managers
have oversight of the status of all current {{safeguarding case}}s and can ensure that they are resolved promptly.

Any operator may raise a {{safeguarding case}} about someone. {{Safeguarding}} Managers are notified, review the {{safeguarding case}}, and assign a
{{safeguarding lead contact}} to the case. The {{safeguarding lead contact}} adds details to the case as it proceeds, sharing limited information with
other team members as appropriate. At the resolution of the case a final report can be recorded and the case signed off
by a manager.

Almost all data is write once, and all changes are logged within the {{safeguarding case}} itself, so a full audit trail
is available. Once saved, records can only be commented on further. This protects the integrity of the record. Access to records
added to a {{safeguarding case}} are highly restricted.

A dashboard view allows {{safeguarding}} managers to see an overview of the status of all investigations to ensure that
{{safeguarding case}}s are progressed promptly. Reports provide more detailed statistical breakdowns of {{safeguarding case}}s raised.

As well as managing {{safeguarding case}}s, the module also allows you to record DBS check results and prompts when
checks are missing and when renewals become due. 

The [{{safeguarding}} system admin](/help/p/33.9.0) pages will be useful if you are just getting started with the module.
