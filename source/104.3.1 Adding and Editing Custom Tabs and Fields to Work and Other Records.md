# 104.3.1 Adding and Editing Custom Tabs and Fields to Work and Other Records

**It is possible to add additional tabs and fields to your {{work}}, {{referral}} and other {{activity}} records through system administration**

In the system administration menu page, there is a section called 'Manage Custom Fields and Drop-down Lists'. This is where you'll find options for adding and managing custom fields and tabs on different types of {{activity}} record.

1. Click on Custom Fields and Drop-down {{Group}}s

2. Under each {{activity}} type is a &#039;manage custom tabs and fields&#039; section. The process is almost identical to adding custom tabs and fields on profiles.

Here within profiles

**Creating Tabs, Fields and Field Options**

The process for this is exactly the same as if you were adding new tabs, fields and field options in a profile. For more details, see [104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/104.2). For advice on which type of field to use to ensure you capture the data you need and can report back on it, see [104.3 Which Custom Fields to Choose in {{Activity}} Records](/help/index/p/104.3).

**Adding Fields to a Standard System Tab**

There are some standard tabs in all {{activity}} records. In a work record, these are 'Where and Where', 'Attendance', (although they could be called something slightly different in your system). You can't edit of delete the fields which already exist in these tabs (in limited circumstances it may be possible for Lamplight to do this for you), but you can add additional fields to them by 'creating' them in System Admin.  Create a tab with the correct name as below, (it doesn't matter what your version of the tab is called - you will need to use these original names and capitalisation is essential), then you can add fields to it.

**{{Work}} records**

- When and where
- Attendance
- Details

**{{Outcome}} records**

- When and where
- Respondent (if you have this tab)

**{{Referral}} records**

- When and where
- Attendance (if you have this tab)
- Involving (if you have this tab)
- details

**{{Grant}} records**

- When and where
- Attendance
- details

**Changing the Order of Tabs, Fields and Options**

You can re-order tabs, fields and options in the list, which will in turn change the order they are shown in the rest of Lamplight. To reorder tabs: 

- Find the one you would like to change, click on it, then use the up and down arrows to the right of it to change its position in the list. 
- Alternatively you can reorder all of your tabs in alphabetical order by clicking on the 'sort' button above the list. Pressing this button once will arrange the tabs in alphabetical order, while pressing again will sort them in reverse order.

The same principal applies to sorting fields (which can be moved up and down within their tab), and options (which can be reordered within the field):

- Click on the field or option that you  want to move, then use the arrow buttons to the right of the one you want to move. 
- If you want to arrange all fields in a tab (or all options in a field) in alphabetical order, use the 'sort' button at the top of the list.

To find the 'sort' button which will order the fields within a tab, click on the tab name and the sort button will be displayed immediately below it. 

To find the 'sort' button which will arrange options within a specific field, click on the field name, then the button with three dots to the right of it. The 'sort' button appears at the top of the list of options.

**Editing and Deleting Tabs, Fields and Options**

This is the same as for custom tabs and fields in the profile. Please see [104.2 Adding and Editing Profile Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/104.2)). If you are thinking of editing an existing field which already has data in it, please also see [105 Troubleshooting Custom Tabs and Fields](/help/index/p/105).
