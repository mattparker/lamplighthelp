# 109 <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> {{Profile}}s - Uploading Profile Data to {{Lamplight}} (System Admin)

> Profile information can be uploaded in bulk to {{Lamplight}}.


In {{Lamplight}} we identify two different types of information:

1. Information you hold about people and {{org}}s, for example gender and address

2. Information you hold about the activities that you do with them, for example {{referral}} information and {{case}} notes


Your System Administrators can import the first type of information (about {{people}} and {{org}}s) using an Excel spreadsheet. The 
second type of information (about activities) is more complex and will need to be imported by Lamplight (please contact us at 
[hello@lamplightdb.co.uk](mailto:hello@lamplightdb.co.uk) if you need more information).

To get started with uploading profile information about people and {{org}}s see [109.1 Preparing Profile Information to 
Import to Lamplight](/help/index/p/109.1).
