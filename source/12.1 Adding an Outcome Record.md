# 12.1 Adding an Outcome Record

There are a number of different places that you can add {{outcome}} records for your {{user}}s. If you want to open the whole {{outcome}}s record, you can do this from the main menu or profile.

You can add scores, comments and details for a number of outcome measures in one go. Although like all {{activity}} records, {{outcome}}s are stored centrally, you can get to them in a number of different places.


**First option: From the main menu**

1. Click on ‘Activities’ on the main menu

3. The {{outcome}}s page will display

**Second option: In the &#039;{{Outcome}}s&#039; tab of a profile**

1. Open the required profile and click on the ‘{{outcome}}s’ tab

**In a {{Work}} Record Context Menu**

1. Choose 'Add {{outcome}}s' from the context menu when viewing {{work}} records in a table [9.1 Viewing {{Work}} Records in the Profile](/help/index/p/9.1) and [24 Viewing {{Work}}, Referral and Other Activity Record Tables](/help/index/p/24)

Please note, this option is only available when using the attendance table, and not the simple search option (tab referenced as 'Respondent') as mentioned in [12.2.1 {{Outcome}} Records: Adding New Profiles Via the Attendance Table](/help/index/p/12.2.1).

Only one {{user}} can be added to a simple respondent box. Once you've moved away from the original {{work}} record there is not a connection to the other {{user}}s.

If you do open the {{outcome}} record from here it will automatically add the same time and date, {{workarea}}, {{user}}s and {{staff}} (if using the 'attendance' tab) as are entered in the {{work}} record. You will need to remember to change these as necessary.  

We would advise that you only use this if there is a single {{user}} attending the {{work}} record. It is only possible to record one set of results per {{outcome}} record, and it is unusual that two {{user}}s would have exactly the same results.


**Adding Outcome Scores through the Outcomes Tab**

It is also possible to add {{outcome}} scores to an individual through the {{Outcome}}s tab in their profile. Please see:

- [12.3 Adding Scores from the Radar Chart](/help/index/p/12.3)
- [12.4 Adding {{Outcome}} Details from the {{Outcome}} Specific Tab](/help/index/p/12.4)
