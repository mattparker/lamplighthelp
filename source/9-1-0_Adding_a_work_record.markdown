# 9.1.0    Adding a {{work}} record

> To add a {{work}} record, go to '{{Work}} -> add' on the main menu 

To add a {{work}} record, go to {{Work}}->Add new -> {{Work}} on the main menu. You will see the main screen for entering records:

![Adding a {{work}} record]({{imgpath}}54a.png)

It is possible to customise the system to add extra fields and tabs, so your system may differ to the example here. See section [18.4.0  Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.4.0) for more information about customising {{work}} records.

The record is split up into at least three tabs: when and where it happened ([9.1.1  When and where](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.1)); who was there ([9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2)); and the details of what happened ([9.1.4  Completing the 'details' tab in a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.4)).

When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right.
