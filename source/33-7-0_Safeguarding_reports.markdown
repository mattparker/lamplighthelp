# 33.7.0 {{Safeguarding concern}} reports

> {{Safeguarding}} Managers can view reports of all {{safeguarding concerns}}, broken down in various ways.

To view {{safeguarding}} reports, go to report > more... > {{safeguarding}} report on the main menu.

The report is very like the {{linked case}} report. By default when you run the report you will see each {{safeguarding case}},
with various summary data about it.  This can be changed in the report presentation tab to show {{safeguarding case}}s grouped
by status, severity, or other metrics.

See [14.6.0 {{Linked case}} report](/help/index/p/14.6.0) for full help about the {{linked case}} report.
