# 10.1.5 <i class="fas fa-envelope-open"></i> {{Comm}}s: Adding Message Content

> Your actual message text is entered in the 'Message content' tab



### Adding Message Content

- If you are creating mailing labels, you’ll see a mail-merge address block is already present in the text box.  You can edit this if you choose, but don’t need to do anything else.
- For letters and emails you can click on the + in the top right of the text box, which will reveal the rich text editing tools.

- If you have chosen to send a separate letter or email to each person, you can use the ‘People Mail Merge’ drop-down menu.  It contains a number of fields which you can add so that your message autofills information. Choose them from the drop-down list and use them in your text as you would actual content. For example, I can write ‘Dear (space), select ‘first name’ from the drop-down list before moving to the next line.  When merged, ‘First name’ will be replaced by the name of each person you send your email to.
- You can copy and paste into the text box. We recommend pasting as plain text, or pasting the text into Notebook first, and then copying from there, to make sure that any existing html formatting is removed. The text editor will try to filter extra code, which can have unexpected results. 

There are also some buttons in the rich text editor which will help you to check your text for html issues:

![HTML Check Buttons](88b.png)

  - The first button lets you edit the HTML content of your message directly. 
  - The second button checks the HTML you have entered and filters it if necessary. This filtering happens when you send/create the message, so clicking this button lets you double-check the content of your message. If your message corrupts or seems to disappear there is a problem with the formatting codes that you are pasting. You'll need to delete the content of your message, and then click the third button which switches the filter on or off. 
  - The third button is on by default. When this is unclicked the editor will not run the filters and whatever you paste will be sent as it is. This should be OK for emails, but it is very likely to cause problems if you are creating letters. {{Lamplight}} translates HTML into Rich Text Format documents, but expects valid HTML to convert (which Microsoft code isn't, for example). If you need to do this you may want to send a test email first. 


### Testing and Sending 

![Saving, testing or creating a {{comm}}](83c.png)

There are three options once you've completed your {{comm}}:

- The 'test' button will produce a test version of the document, or for emails will send a copy to your own email address. Do not navigate away from the 'Message content' tab in {{Lamplight}} while you look at it so that you can make any amendments before sending.
- The ‘Save but do not send’ button only works if you have the {{Comm}}s Module, so that you can create drafts and return to them later.
- Click 'Create/Send' to create the document or send the email.  

If you have created letters or mailing labels, they will either open directly in Word for you to print out, or appear in a download box at the bottom of your screen. Click on this to open it. 

If you have created email, this will send directly from your account. (Please note, you will need to have added your email settings in the system admin section for this to work. For more information on this, please see [16.11.0 Setting Up Email](/help/index/p/16.11.0)).

Please note, if you do not have the {{Comm}}s Module your {{comm}} will not be saved in the system. For more on the module, please see [21.0.0 The {{Comm}}s Module](/help/index/p/21.0.0).
