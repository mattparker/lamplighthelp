# 60.0.0 {{Grant}} Records

> {{Grant}} records in Lamplight allow you to record money coming into your organisation

You can keep records of money coming in to your organisation using {{grant}} records. If you can't see these in your system, it is possible for a System Administrator to turn them on in global settings (see [16.12.2 Global Settings: Data to Store](/help/index/p/16.12.2) for more details).

These records can be used in a number of different ways:
- For grants and donations coming in to the organisation.
- To keep track of payments in kind.
- To show donations and grants given to clients - money for shoes, for example.

Once you are using {{grant}} records, it is possible to use custom and template reports to show the amounts involved in the timescales you choose. For more information, see [14.7.0 {{Grant}} {{Report}}s](/help/index/p/14.7.0).
