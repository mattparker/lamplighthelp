# 7.1.3    Adding New {{People}} to the Database from Within a {{Work}} Record

> If you have new people attending a {{work}} session who do not yet have a profile in {{Lamplight}}, you can add them to the system  while creating the {{work}} record

If you are adding {{people}} or {{org}}s to an attendance table and you have someone who is not yet on the system, you can add them to {{Lamplight}} at this point. (You may not be able to do this if your organisation has some custom required fields when adding a new profile). 
- Type in their name in the search box.
- If they do not show up on the drop-down menu click the 'add new people to database' button on the right. 
- A popup window will appear asking you to confirm their details:

- Click the 'save' button on the pop-up window when you have checked the information.

- {{Lamplight}} will double-check for similar names already on the system. If it finds any similarities, they will be shown in another popup window:

- If you want to use one of these existing {{people}}, click the row of the table in the popup window and they will be added to the main attendance table. 
- If you are certain that they are not already on the system, click the 'click here' button at the bottom right of the pop-up box and they will be added to the main attendance list. A profile will also be created for them.

**Please note**: the new profile will be set up with the name only, and a role on your system on {{user}}. To add more details to the profile, and to change the role if needed, you will need to find and edit it. For more on this, see [5.1.0 Profiles](/help/index/p/5.1.0).
