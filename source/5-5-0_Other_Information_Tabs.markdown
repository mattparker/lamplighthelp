# 5.5.0 Custom Profile Tabs

> Custom tabs in a profile contain information about {{people}} that's unlikely to change often, for example demographic details. The information you put in here can be overwritten as necessary 

{{Lamplight}} allows you to add as many tabs and fields as you need to in order to record your information. Custom tabs are unique to your organisation, and contain information that your organisation needs for its work and reporting. 

There are a number of different types of field:
- Select box - select a single option from the list of options.
- Multi-select box - select as many options as apply. To select several options, hold the Ctrl key down and click all the options you need. If you need to deselect an option, hold down the Ctrl key and click on it again. 
- Plain text area - a box which lets you enter a short amount of free text.
- Plain text box - a larger area to enter longer amounts of free text.
- Rich text - another area to enter free text, and you can add formatting to it.
- Check box - click on the box to fill in a tick.
- Radio button - click on the button to indicate a yes.
- Dates - dates are entered in UK format by selecting from the day/month/year select boxes, or you can use the pop-up calendar to find the date.
- Times - times are entered on a 24 hour clock from select boxes.
- Number box - {{Lamplight}} will only accept numbers in this box - no text, spaces or other characters.
- Charity number look-up - allows the charity number of an organisation to be entered, along with a link to their page on the Charity Commission web-site.

If the option you need is not there, speak to your system administrator about what needs to be added. If you have the appropriate permission levels, see section [16.7.2 Adding Custome Tabs and Fields in Profiles](/help/index/p/16.7.2). 

You can edit a number of the fields in each tab at the same time. To do this, click on 'Edit tab' to the right of the page. Click on 'Save' at the bottom right of the page when you have finished. 

If you would like a demonstration of how this works, you can watch our 'Custom Tabs and Fields in Profiles' video.
