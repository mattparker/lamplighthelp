# 19.4.0    No more select boxes with lists of {{people}} - search as you type.  

> The drop-down select boxes in version 2.x with lists of {{user}}s have gone. Instead there are now text boxes that search as you type, giving you the best matches available. Start typing, and click on the name as soon as you see it. 

You can also use the arrow and 'enter' keys on the keyboard to select someone on the list, search in different ways, and add {{group}}s of {{people}} to a record in one go - see section [8.1.0  Finding {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.1.0) for more details.

This makes data entry much easier than searching through long drop-downs, and makes the system faster, as it only loads details as they are needed.
