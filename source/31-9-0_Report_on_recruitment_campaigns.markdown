# 31.9.0 Reporting on your {{recruiter}} campaign

> The {{recruiter}} report shows how many applications you received from different groups
> to assist your equalities monitoring and improvement.

After the shortlisting decision has been made you can run a report on the campaign.  
Go to {{people}} > {{recruiter}} > view campaigns and find the correct campaign.  If
all questions have been scored, you'll see a button to 'Report'.

Clicking this will take you into the reporting function and show the number of applications you received,
broken down by the different equalities fields that you chose for the campaign.  You can use this 
to help monitor whether you are receiving applications from a broad range of people.
